    Bringing a local park into the 21st Century and ensuring the   				continued wellbeing of its native wildlife is not as simple as   				you may think.<br />
  <br />
    Take Queen&rsquo;s Park in Crewe as an example; Cheshire East Council   				(CEC) is currently investing £6.5m into restoring the park to   				its former glory but have also been tasked with meeting the   				demands of certain feathered visitors and the park&rsquo;s more   				permanent resident: bats.<br />
  <br />
    The bats, four different protected species, have made the   				existing bandstand area their home over the past few years and   				seemed contented to stay put. However, for human visitors, the   				old, leaky roof had become somewhat of an eyesore. A series of   				surveys identified when the bats would leave the site to roost   				elsewhere. At this point the roof was refurbished and pieces of   				plywood suspended from the ceiling to provide more suitable   				accommodation for these flying mammals.<br />
  <br />
    Cheshire East Councillor Andrew Knowles, Cabinet Member with   				Responsibility for Parks, said;<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;This is proof that the numerous surveys which have been carried   				out to protect wildlife in the park are paying off. Improving   				life for birds and bats as well as ourselves is the main aim of   				this project. The work which has been completed has already   				revitalised the area. This can only continue as the project   				nears completion.&rdquo;<br />

    Case Study, Mark Stubbs – A member of the South East Cheshire   				Ornithological Society, said:<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;I recently decided to pay a visit to the Queen's Park in Crewe   				to see what birds were present. Having spent the last few years   				conducting bird surveys in the urban Crewe area, surprisingly I   				hadn't visited the park, so it was something I had to do for   				curiosity's sake.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;I arrived at the entrance opposite Tipkinder Park and   				immediately saw a Coal Tit. Next I saw a Jay, in my opinion, one   				of our most beautiful resident<br />
    birds. Wood Pigeon, Collared Dove (picture left), Mistle Thrush,   				Great Tit and Blue Tit soon followed. A Tree Creeper climbing up   				a tree by the play area continued a good start to the walk and   				as I proceeded, resident songbirds were in evidence, such as   				Robin, Wren and Dunnock.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;All of a sudden, the unmistakable undulating flight of a   				Greater Spotted Woodpecker overhead was noted before it landed   				in a treetop. Blackbirds and Song Thrushes, which were worming   				on the grassed areas, were joined by several Redwings. There   				have been large numbers of this Scandinavian thrush in the UK   				this winter, and birds are not only turning up in parks, but in   				gardens as well.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;At the Victoria Avenue entrance, House Sparrows were chirping   				on the Gatehouse buildings and in the adjacent area, Magpie,   				Crow, Jackdaw, feral Pigeon and Pied Wagtail were noted.   				Chaffinch, Greenfinch and Goldfinch were soon added to the list   				and then I heard a Goldcrest. After a minute or so it gave   				itself up, flicking away in the foliage, looking for insects.   				It's amazing how this, our smallest British bird, survives   				considering we've just experienced our harshest winter in over   				thirty years.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;In the lake area I saw approximately 70 Mallard along with a   				single male<br />
    Mandarin Duck. Originally one of a breeding pair present since   				2000, the male has been on his own since 2003, and resident ever   				since. Fifteen Canada Geese, a single feral Greylag Goose, with   				the farmyard type white geese, four Moorhen and a grey Heron   				were also seen, along with 15 Black-headed and two Common Gulls,   				hanging around, hoping for an easy meal when people come to feed   				the ducks bread.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;So, it just goes to show that you don't have to visit the   				countryside to experience bird life when it's on your own   				doorstep!&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
    There have been more additions to the park to ensure Queen&rsquo;s   				Park remains a &lsquo;des-res&rsquo; for all manner of local wildlife. These   				include a number of nest boxes:<br />
  <br />
    10 Tit boxes – various size entrance holes, 25mm-32mm;<br />
    2 Treecreeper boxes;<br />
    2 open fronted boxes;<br />
    1 larger box – 45mm entrance hole;<br />
    1 Hawk box and;<br />
    1 large owl box;<br />
  <br />
    There are plans to erect more boxes in the future, including 2   				owl chimneys.<br />
  <br />
    Another habitat booster that has been introduced over the last   				two years is the creation of small discreet log piles.   				Sometimes, this may just be one large log or bough, placed   				within a shrubbery. The decaying wood attracts fungi and   				insects, the latter providing a good food source for many other   				animals.<br />
  <br />
    Plus, the more unusual....<br />
  <br />
    The Mandarin Duck, referred to by Mark Stubbs is an uncommon   				feature around Britain&rsquo;s parks, but one permanently resides in   				Queen&rsquo;s Park and his late family members before him since 1980.   				Plus, a more recent welcome visitor is the Cope Shields Duck,   				seen numerous times over the last two weeks; it is thought to   				have either escaped or been set free as it is not a native of   				these shores.<br />

It interesting to look   							back at the whole year and we have the 2009 photos   							and news on line as well at the main <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crewetown.co.uk/"> Queens Park website</a>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TRU8ghKZ_-I/AAAAAAAADbk/jfd_0IvwgzQ/s1600-h/DSCF2756[3].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2756" alt="DSCF2756" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TRU8hX-wzrI/AAAAAAAADbo/7lJrX9kD2h0/DSCF2756_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="390" width="520" /></a></p>
            <p>The Queens Park lake is frozen over once again   							and the idiots are out. The above shot of the lads   							running across the lake</p>
            <p> and jumping about on it. There is also bike   							tracks across the lake. What they dont realize is if   							it breaks and they fall in they</p>
            <p> could be in serious trouble as the   							temperature is so low. The problem is if they do   							fall in someone from emergency services</p>
            <p> may have to risk their lives to rescue   							them. So be smart and safe and stay off the lake.</p>

            <p>The ducks are out enjoying a game of football on   							the lake and seem fascinated by the football. There   							has been </p>
            <p>some feathers near the golf coarse end of the   							lake which suggest something or someone is killing   							them.</p>

            <p>With the bad weather the Queens Park has become a   							winter wonder land for those brave enough to brave   							the sub zero weather. early in the week it was cold   							and foggy giving a mystical feel.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-Y-NLisI/AAAAAAAADZA/cxtzVaqxSLM/s1600-h/DSCF2712[4].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2712" alt="DSCF2712" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-Z3skD9I/AAAAAAAADZE/_Ce_V9AHyKw/DSCF2712_thumb[2].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="377" width="503" /></a></p>
            <p>The sun broke through later in the week but it   							was still very cold. What is shocking as you can see   							above people have been breaking into the park behind   							the barriers and throwing all sorts of things onto   							the lake. You can see metal fence, plastic fence and   							big rubber feet off the fences on the lake. The   							problem is as the lake melts all this is going into   							the lake which we have spent a fortune having it   							cleaned. It represents a danger to wildlife.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-kHJWR4I/AAAAAAAADZI/nAlR8FzjB4U/s1600-h/DSCF2715[3].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2715" alt="DSCF2715" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-lUkkSoI/AAAAAAAADZM/kkTCmQHLXlA/DSCF2715_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="378" width="503" /></a></p>
            <p>Getting any work done this week has been touch   							and go due to the freezing weather but the Bowls hut   							has had a crane there putting the steal work in and   							its starting to take shape slowly</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-yM-suwI/AAAAAAAADZQ/ITfDnoRMUNs/s1600-h/DSCF2696[3].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2696" alt="DSCF2696" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-zh8f1jI/AAAAAAAADZY/4nOJ35mKhfw/DSCF2696_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="375" width="499" /></a> .</p>
            <p>The geese and ducks have been wondering about   							down the main drive due to the bad weather. You can   							see how frosty it has been with the trees pure   							white.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK--LTK7CI/AAAAAAAADZc/YYk0zjeH-J4/s1600-h/DSCF2700[3].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2700" alt="DSCF2700" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK-_A5J7fI/AAAAAAAADZg/TTuu5UP5rz8/DSCF2700_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="365" width="486" /></a></p>
            <p>Despite the bad weather the play area is getting   							the new set of swings put in. The weather is against   							it as they cant cement them in while its so cold.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK_JFu-3-I/AAAAAAAADZk/ign75KSX-n4/s1600-h/DSCF2707[3].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2707" alt="DSCF2707" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TQK_KNHtY5I/AAAAAAAADZo/iW1W_tximu8/DSCF2707_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="352" width="469" /></a></p>
            <p>As well as the new swings the ground is being   							prepared for the new climbing frame for older   							youths. It was hoped to get it in before Xmas but   							its all down to the weather as they can cement or   							put the rubber down in the bad weather</p>

                            <p>By Tipkinder entrance bird feeders have been   placed and   					the birds are flocking to get their food.

                            <p>Father Christmas is   taking time off from his busy   					schedule to join in with the   children&rsquo;s lantern procession   					and other fun activities, at   Queen&rsquo;s Park in Crewe, on   					December 5. </p>
                            <p>The procession   starts at 4.30pm at the main entrance to   					the park. Staff from   Cheshire East Council have been   					visiting schools around Crewe   making decorations for the   					children to carry during the event. </p>
                            <p>A festive sing song   is planned around the park&rsquo;s   					Christmas tree. It will be led by   Reverend Steven Clapham   					from All Saints Church. He will also be   giving an   					interactive presentation reminding people of what   Advent is   					all about.</p>
                            <p>The evening is   being organised by the Friends Group, in   					partnership with Crewe   and Nantwich Lions, and it is the   					second year the lantern   procession has been held at Queen&rsquo;s   					Park.</p>
                            <p>Councillor Andrew   Knowles, Cabinet member with   					responsibility for health and   wellbeing, said: &ldquo;This is sure   					to be a special occasion and   events like this improve   					community life.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The event is free of charge as well, which is good news   					for families at an expensive time of year.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Councillor Dorothy   Flude, ward member for Crewe South,   					said: &ldquo;I hope the people of   Crewe will come out and support   					this event.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Christmas is a special time for children and I am sure   					that the lantern procession will be a big success.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The bowls pavilion   is progressing slowly with the   					Sandstone being fitted. Most of   the work is at the rear so   					far so you cant really see very much. </p>

                            <p>While in the same   area with my new super Finepix HS10   					camera with 30X optical zoom I   took a snap of the bell on   					top of the West Lodge I wonder how   many walk past the lodge   					and never look and see the bell?</p>

                              <p>The new   																cafeteria at   																Queens Park has   																reached a   																milestone – with   																the impressive   																timber structure   																soaring into   																place.</p>
                              <p>A specialist   																company has been   																involved in   																installing the   																timbers due to   																their size,   																weight and   																complex fixing   																arrangement. The   																design will   																enable users to   																view the   																internal timbers   																when inside the   																new building.</p>

                              <p>The wall   																materials, on   																both the café   																and games   																pavilion, have   																been carefully   																chosen to match,   																where possible,   																the sandstone on   																the two lodges   																located at the   																Crewe park&rsquo;s   																main entrance.   																The dark-red St   																Bees sandstone   																is the same as   																that which forms   																the sea cliffs   																of St Bees Head,   																near Whitehaven,   																in Cumbria. </p>
                              <p>Councillor   																Andrew Knowles,   																Cabinet member   																with   																responsibility   																for health and   																wellbeing, said:   																&ldquo;The pace this   																building is   																going up is   																satisfying to   																see. But the   																really great   																thing is that   																you can now   																visualise what   																it will finally   																look like once   																completed and   																see the scale of   																the new   																facility.&rdquo;</p>
                              <p>Work on the   																project began in   																July. It is   																hoped the   																construction   																will be   																completed by   																February.</p>
                              <p>Crewe West   																ward member   																Councillor   																Robert Parker   																said: &ldquo;I am   																delighted with   																the building   																work on the new   																cafeteria. The   																attention to   																detail is   																particularly   																inspiring and I   																feel, once the   																whole   																restoration   																project is   																finally   																complete, Queens   																Park will be a   																major tourist   																attraction in   																the North West   																and a magnet for   																visitors to   																Crewe.&rdquo;</p>
                              <p>Queens Park   																was renowned as   																one of the   																finest parks in   																the North West.   																It is undergoing   																a £6.5m   																transformation   																to bring it back   																to its former   																glory. The   																Heritage Lottery   																Fund is   																providing a   																£2.7m support   																grant with the   																rest of the   																investment   																coming from   																Cheshire East   																Council.</p>
                              <p>Within the   																park&rsquo;s 45 acres   																are walkways,   																trees, shrubs,   																planting,   																children&rsquo;s play   																area, crown   																green bowling,   																putting, boating   																lake (currently   																drained for   																construction   																works), grassed   																areas, memorials   																and cafeteria. </p>

            <p>New buildings at Queens Park are taking shape –   							and causing a buzz of interest in Crewe.</p>
            <p>Work on the frames and striking sandstone walls   							of the new cafeteria and games pavilion has got   							under way – putting a modern twist on the park&rsquo;s   							Victorian heritage.</p>
            <p>Formed more than 250 million years ago, in the   							permo-triassic age, the stone is called &lsquo;St Bees&rsquo;.   							It is a dark-red sandstone which forms the sea   							cliffs of St Bees Head, near Whitehaven in Cumbria. </p>
            <p>The materials for the two buildings have been   							carefully chosen to match, where possible, the two   							sandstone lodges at the park&rsquo;s main entrance.</p>
            <p>Councillor Andrew Knowles, Cabinet Member with   							responsibility for Health and Wellbeing, said: &ldquo;The   							new build has created a lot of interest in Queens   							Park which is satisfying to see, particularly given   							the attention to detail and the modern twist on the   							Victorian theme of the park. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;The new pavilion and café are wonderful   							facilities and the improvements will encourage more   							people into the park.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The building work is drawing on the latest   							engineering skills in the same manner as our   							Victorian predecessors, when they first constructed   							the park for the people of the area.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Work on the project began in July. It is hoped   							the construction will be completed by February.</p>
            <p>The St Bees sandstone been sourced from Birkhams   							Quarry, in Whitehaven. </p>
            <p>St Bees sandstone was originally used as ballast   							on ships to the US and then as a brownstone   							substitute for building in the US and Canada.</p>
            <p>Its physical performance results in a sandstone   							which is extremely durable and versatile. It has   							been used on restoration projects such as Liverpool   							Anglican Cathedral and the Chester Song School, part   							of Chester Cathedral. </p>
            <p>The stone has been used widely in Britain and   							especially in Cheshire, Cumbria, Liverpool,   							Manchester, the Wirral and Wales.</p>
            <p>Queens Park was renowned as one of the finest   							parks in the North West. It is undergoing a £6.5m   							transformation to bring it back to is former glory.   							The Heritage Lottery Fund is providing a £2.7m   							support grant with the rest of the investment coming   							from Cheshire East Council.</p>
            <p>Within the park&rsquo;s 45 acres are walkways, trees,   							shrubs, planting, children&rsquo;s play area, crown green   							bowling, putting, boating lake (currently drained   							for construction works), grassed areas, memorials   							and cafeteria. </p>
            <p>For more information on the Queens Park   							restoration project visit<strong> </strong>the Queens Park web   							pages at: www.cheshireeast.gov.uk – then click   							&lsquo;Leisure, Culture and Tourism&rsquo;, then follow links to   							park the pages.</p>

            <p>The mud mountain by the main rd is all but   							finished and has been levelled off. This was needed   							to stop the wall collapsing and to make it safe for   							disabled people. There is now a slight bank so it   							should now be ok for everyone.</p>

            <p>The   Sluice Gates at Tipkinder which are used to   fill the Lake were getting a   overhaul this week. Originally made in   Crewe works they are generally   working well but a few improvements are   needed.</p>

            <p>The mud mountain near the main road has had bull   dozers on it all week   levelling it off and creating a slope into   coronation walk thankfully   the 3 million year old stone has now been   removed from the walk into the   office before someone through it away   thinking it was rubbish</p>
            <p>   <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TJadO6dc5DI/AAAAAAAADJg/9j9Vt_zaLWk/s1600-h/DSCF2108%5B2%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF2108" alt="DSCF2108" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TJadP19NGtI/AAAAAAAADJk/SCaLTu5vUjs/DSCF2108_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a></p>
            <p> Its been a strange week with on one hand the   Butterflies still out   enjoying the flowers and what we think of as a   winter visitor the Robin   seen down by the lake </p>

            <p> What is clear is that winter is on its way as   Autumn comes to the park   with the first trees starting to change   colour the trees on the far side   of the lake are the first to go.   There will be some good pictures  in   the near future as Autumn colour   takes over</p>

            <p>A lot of work has happened around the Cafe this week. The new steel work arrived and was put in place with a crane</p>
            <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlrhK830JI/AAAAAAAADHA/Zfb2Odf2Fk4/s1600-h/DSCF0234%5B5%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF0234" alt="DSCF0234" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlriC9f0aI/AAAAAAAADHI/52SFUIiNJJQ/DSCF0234_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="308" width="406" /></a> <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlrqaunh-I/AAAAAAAADHM/MiX-lm0f-a0/s1600-h/DSCF0242%5B5%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF0242" alt="DSCF0242" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlrrY0uNkI/AAAAAAAADHQ/AOhojzg8QXc/DSCF0242_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="321" width="423" /></a> <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlrzr16V4I/AAAAAAAADHU/JY0H_VfdIyw/s1600-h/DSCF0244%5B5%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF0244" alt="DSCF0244" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlr0gcObOI/AAAAAAAADHY/uwajBhXXVU8/DSCF0244_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="321" width="424" /></a></p>
            <p>As   you can see the cafe is now taking shape    with the basic walls and   steel work in place you can appreciate the   size of it now  </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlr-kl_9PI/AAAAAAAADHc/DLjBKB2L8Sk/s1600-h/DSCF0256%5B5%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF0256" alt="DSCF0256" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlr_k27aoI/AAAAAAAADHk/WS519q0CJPk/DSCF0256_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="416" width="411" /></a></p>
            <p>The   fence around the lake has been replaced   between the two bridges and the   gardeners have been seeding the slope   so it can be fully opened once   the grass has grown. But it does mean   you can now take some pictures of   the lake</p>
            <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlsJIb0yoI/AAAAAAAADHo/9fCX1lRuhHE/s1600-h/DSCF0262%5B4%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF0262" alt="DSCF0262" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlsJ4bEeeI/AAAAAAAADHs/LVquFdfbNf8/DSCF0262_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="324" width="426" /></a></p>
            <p>Outside the park by the Golf Coarse the path has now been laid which will be part of the cycle track to Nantwich </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlsXvyqw2I/AAAAAAAADHw/MiukrXyrAPc/s1600-h/DSCF0269%5B5%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF0269" alt="DSCF0269" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TIlsZHz77fI/AAAAAAAADH4/rGJLXmBHiu4/DSCF0269_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="315" width="416" /></a></p>
            <p>Finally   the bowls hut walls are starting to   grow and this was one of the hot   topics at the meeting as to prevent   the project going over budget the   hut will not now have any shutters   on the windows</p>

            <p>The   metal fence near the lake has been removed   between the bridges and you   can now see the lake at its best. The duck   were struggling after being   used to going under it the plastic fence   was keeping them guessing how   to get under </p>

            <p>Finally   on the top near the bandstand were all   the excess  mud  had built up   they have bulldozers levelling it off so   hopefully we will soon be able   to use the new bandstand</p>

            <p>The   metal fencing around the lake was being   removed to day and replaced   with a nylon barrier which means you can   see the lake better and take   pictures of it now. The bank has to be   grassed over to make it safe and   they should start that this week. Up   near the band stand the bull dozers   were hard at work getting the top   areas straight again</p>

            <p>A strange site for anyone entering the park today as giant balls were seen floating about. It turned out the local firm  <a href="http://www.zorb-itevents.co.uk/default.html" target="_blank">Zorb it events</a> had   brought the Zorb over for a fun day out so people could give them   a try   and there was lots of interest as the kids all wanted ago. The   new play   area was heavily used as well and the  official open is   tommorow</p>

            <p>Over   near the main entrance the mud mountain by   Coronation Walk had   bulldozers levelling it out. It will give us a   flat road so its safe for   disabled and all so help to support the   outside wall which was in   danger of collapsing. It will be levelled   off  and a smooth path down to   the walk</p>

            <p>I   wondered what was going on with the bowls hut   I could have sworn the   foundation had been put in but its all gone.   It turns out they had made   an error and been 1.3 meters out so they   have had to start again</p>
            <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TG2zO8l7DyI/AAAAAAAAC9A/G-ce_JgxOro/s1600-h/DSCF1969%5B4%5D.jpg"><img title="DSCF1969" alt="DSCF1969" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TG2zPhNfGaI/AAAAAAAAC9E/Y8TCry7yffA/DSCF1969_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="297" width="392" /></a></p>
            <p>New   keep fit equipment has gone in at the rear   of the bowls hut so now you   can get down to the park and have a free   work out. I am sure the Park   manager will be there every morning   leading by example</p>

            <p>A   long last an old friend Dobin has returned to   the Queens Park play area   It an old favourite of many children and   was condemned this year and   removed. But now its back having been   restored back to its former glory   and to bring pleasure to the next   generation of young children in the   new play area </p>

      <p>After some problems with the lake leaking it is now   being filled   slowly again but as they can only do it for 4 hours a day   progress is   slow. The gardeners had fun this week as they had to row   out in a boat   to weed the islands but it did get done and is now weed   free.</p>
      <p>Some   fun in the week when the armed response unit was   called to Tipkinder   after some lads were discharging weapons in the   woods. After a lot of   people rand 999 a unit was dispatched its lucky   no one was hurt shooting   so close to the road even a air weapon can be   deadly if it shoots a   driver</p>

            <p>The big   mystery  this week is what are the   green bales in the lake as seen   above? The answer is to help stop the   algae its basically straw bales    which should hold and collect the   algae.</p>
            <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TCU-rNjh0LI/AAAAAAAACGA/mff4alstAKA/s1600-h/DSCF1438%5B10%5D.jpg"><img title="DSCF1438" alt="DSCF1438" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TCU-r0YebVI/AAAAAAAACGE/4yfKaUtrGNo/DSCF1438_thumb%5B8%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="330" width="513" /></a></p>
            <p>Over near the main   lodge the mountain is   growing this is in fact the old mountain from  by   the bandstand being   moved along with other rubbish to  the old path.   Once finished it will   cut out the old very steep path down to Coronation   Walk which was   unsuitable for wheel chair users. Once completed it will   be a slight   incline that everyone can use</p>

      <p>The bowling Green   above and the cafe are the next   things to be renovated. The Cafe has   been fenced off ready and   demolition will start Wednesday/Thursday this   week.

              <p>As you can see the   lake is still being filled   at the rate of 4 hours a day. They cant fill   it any more due to   restriction of the Environment Agency as it would   effect wildlife etc   down stream. Its beginning to look good and the duck   are still having a   great time</p>

                        <p>The sluice gates   were closed today and the   lake started to fill  after years of being   empty. The duck thought it   was their birthday as they all dived into the   water as it flooded in.   It will take some time to fill the lake up to   two weeks as they can   only fill it for 4 hours at a time as any longer   than that and the   stream across the golf coarse would dry up and could   effect wildlife.   Still it was a magnificent site to see the water final   flowing into   the lake. It will look so different with water in.</p>
                        <p>Did   you know the lake holds 32,397 tons of   water about 6,672,928 imperial   gallons give or take a pint or two, its   hard to get an exact figure as   its not a flat surface but it does   give a rough idea of the amount of   water. More pictures as the lake   fills soon</p>

            The   viewing area by the lake is now finished as   you can see in the above   photo, and the landing stage is nearly   complete and should be finished   next week.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Queens Park Refurbishment is motoring ahead with     Playground works commencing as from the middle of next week with initial     site preliminary works.  Contractors are Country Landscapes, who are     installing equipment from the Wickstead range.  The range of equipment     has been selected given aspirations from Sir William Stanier School   at   Coppenhall, students have been working closely with Cheshire East     Council to ensure younger visitors get a playground which will provide     much play satisfaction.  They were also keen to ensure the range was     inclusive for those with mobility difficulties and also sensory     equipment, plus their 'wish list' included equipment to appeal to all     ages.  Their consultation included liaison with their Feeder Schools so     it our represented youth talking to other young people, ultimately     driving the final design and selection.  The inclusive element has also     received a financial 'boost' from fundraising done by ex The   Worshipful   the Mayor Councillor S Roberts. It is envisaged the   playground will be   completed by the end of August although an earlier   date is hoped to be   achieved. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Progress regarding the filling of Queens Park     Lake.  Some birds can be seen to be nesting on the bed of the lake at     this time, these will need to hatch whilst final preparation works     continue to enable this to happen.  There is also some debris causing a     blockage from the Valley Brook following dumping into the Brook waters     which are being cleared.  It is likely water filling will commence     towards the middle/end of this month.  The initial filling of waters     will need to be gradual and monitored to ensure there is no leakage or     other problems.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, the Building Contractor - Tolent who   did   the park bridges - take possession of the buildings this week.    Works   to the Cafeteria will commence the second week of June, with   temporary   catering facilities provided at weekends and school holidays.    Works   to the Games Pavilion commence the week following, again   temporary   facilities will be provided for Bowlers and other users.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            All   of these imminent elements will be vast move forward in her   refurbishment programme. <br />
            <br />
            Exciting plans for the play area<br />

            There   is still only minor work going on this week.   The wood for the landing   stage is now on site and being put into   place. This is holding up the   filling of the lake as the lake cant be   filled until the work is done or   the men will be working underwater.<br />

              As reported the other day they had trouble   								getting the giant steel support into and in the   								end it had to be done the next day. It was just   								down to a safety computer on the crane which   								wouldn't let it lift the steel as it was to   								windy.<br />
              However on Thursday the wind had dropped and the   								support was in place. <br />
              <br />
              <a onblur="try   {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/S608-WEGtAI/AAAAAAAABsM/TiRnmtDA37E/s1600/IMGP2359.JPG"> <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/S608-WEGtAI/AAAAAAAABsM/TiRnmtDA37E/s400/IMGP2359.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5453081765587891202" border="0" /></a><br />
              There is now some work to do on site welding the   								top supports onto the steel and as you can see   								in the above picture that is now going ahead the   								bridge its self which you can see in the   								background will be lifted into place on Monday   								as the men are working over the weekend to get   								everything ready<br />

              The metal supports for the end of the bridge   								were lifted into place. The work will then be   								completed by Thursday night when all the bridges   								will be fully installed. One of the Burma   								Bridges has yet to be lowered a few feet after   								the initial settling period. The contractor   								Tolent will then be leaving the site after   								Easter but its hoped they will get the Cafe   								contract so they can start work straight away

              Work Started today trying to get the giant steel   								work in for the Broadwalk bridge which will be   								lifted into place on Thursday. They managed to   								get the base fixed with little problems. But   								then the giant crane hit a snag it has a   								computer control which measures the wind speed   								and it would not let them lift as the wind speed   								was to high. They needed to lift the massive   								steel supports very high over the trees in order   								to lower it into place but by 3 o'clock they   								still couldn't do it due to high wind speed. I   								have know doubt they lifted it in the end but we   								watch for several ours as they kept trying only   								to be defeated by the computer and weather. More   								reports tomorrow <br />

      Picture the new massive steel structure on site on Friday ready   				for installation on Monday<br />
  <br />
      Another milestone in the multi-million pound restoration of   				Crewe&rsquo;s Queens Park takes place next week with the installation   				of its grandest bridge.<br />
  <br />
      Following this week&rsquo;s positioning of the Burma Star Bridge,   				Thursday (March 25) will see the 40-metre Broadwalk bridge   				hoisted into place over the Coronation Walk dip.<br />
  <br />
      The structure, which is six metres wide, will span the steep   				incline to improve access between the two halves of the park.<br />
  <br />
      A giant crane will lift the arches in four separate pieces and   				install them on a huge steel central support.<br />
  <br />
      The bridge beams are constructed of sustainable <a href="http://www.meerdink.co.uk/">ekki hardwood</a>, a   				longer-lasting timber which reduces the pressures of logging on   				the forests of the world.<br />
  <br />
      Self-preserving and with self-repairing properties, its timbers   				can only be machined as the wood is too tough to work with hand   				tools. <br />
  <br />
      The new structure is the latest development in the Heritage   				Lottery-funded £6.5m restoration of the 45-acre park, which will   				eventually house five impressive bridges.<br />
  <br />
      Councillor Andrew Knowles, Cabinet member with responsibility   				for health and wellbeing, said: &ldquo;The lifting into place of the   				Burma Star Bridge was a sight to behold and I am sure the   				Broadwalk installation will be just as spectacular.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;The new bridge will be a very impressive structure and will be   				particularly welcomed by people with pushchairs and wheelchair   				users, who will no longer be forced to negotiate the steep   				incline.<br />
      Below the last bridge on Burma island now fully installed<br />

  <br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;The park restoration is really gathering pace now thanks to the   				hard work of the design team whose members are seeking to   				complete works ahead of schedule wherever possible.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;Over the coming months, park users will notice more big changes   				as more areas re-open to the public.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
      The next stage in the restoration will be the completion of the   				lake edges and bed, with the filling of the lake scheduled for   				summer. <br />
  <br />
      The design and selection of the new playground equipment - in   				conjunction with Sir William Stanier School - is currently being   				finalised and will be installed in time for the school summer   				holidays.<br />
  <br />
      Anyone who would like to find out more about the restoration is   				welcome to attend the next meeting of the Friends of Queens Park   				this Wednesday (March 24) at 6pm in the park cafeteria.<br />
  <br />
      Regular updates are available by mail. Please contact Queens   				Park Manager Elaine Dodd on 01270 537896 to register your   				details. </div>

        The crane lifting the bridge into place. next week is the big   				week when the long awaited Broadwalk bridge comes. As its so big   				this will take 3 days starting Monday when the steel support   				will arrive and this will have to be welded on site. Its hoped   				to have the bridge in by Wednesday ready for the Friends meeting   				which is on Wednesday at 6 o'clock at the cafe everyone is   				invited to attend.<br />
        There is now like 2 weeks for the contractor on site and the job   				will be finished its hoped the same firm will get the contract   				for the new cafe as they are already on site and can start   				straight away. </p>

            The Burma Star Bridge – the second largest landmark   							bridge in Crewe&rsquo;s Queens Park – was hoisted into   							place on Wednesday (March 17)<br />
            From 11am onwards, A 300 tonne crane lifted the 22.5   							tonne bridge into place.<br />
            The Burma Star Bridge – named so after the Second   							World War Campaign in the Burma jungles – will arch   							over the Burma Star Island and Memorial, which is   							also undergoing renovation.<br />
            It&rsquo;s all part of a £6.5m restoration of the park,   							thanks to the Heritage Lottery Fund. Eventually, the   							45-acre park will house five impressive bridges.<br />
            Councillor Andrew Knowles, Cabinet member with   							responsibility for parks, said the special occasion   							was close to his heart.<br />
            His uncle, James Knowles, who served as a Chindit   							during the Burma campaign, died in 1944 aged just 20   							years-old. To this day, Andrew has kept a medal he   							won as a keepsake.<br />
            He added: &ldquo;This will be an important part of Crewe&rsquo;s   							history when this bridge finally settles into place.<br />
            &ldquo;This incredible Victorian park is slowly being   							brought back to its former glory thanks to Cheshire   							East Council and its funding partners, as well as   							all the help and support from members of the public   							who have been extremely patient during renovations.&rdquo;<br />
            The Burma Star Bridge is a tribute to the Burma Star   							Association who refer to themselves as the   							&ldquo;Forgotten Regiment&rdquo;.<br />
            The Burma Star Association was officially founded on   							the 26 February 1951, with 2000 founder members who   							exist to promote the comradeship experienced during   							the bitter fighting in the jungles of Burma, as well   							as help members and their families in times of   							ill-health and poverty.<br />
            The Association has representatives from the Royal   							Navy, Army Royal Air Force and Royal British Legion   							on the National Council.<br />

        The second bridge arrived at the park today. It taken all   					week to lay over 800 tons of hardcore in order to get the   					crane and bridge on site with over 300 tons just for the   					crane. Its not the biggest bridge but as it has steep paths   					to it there was difficulty getting a massive lorry and crane   					down to the site.<br />
        <br />
        It started at about 11 o'clock when the steel work came   					first and was lifted into place as we all held our breath.   					As it was built off site and the tolerance was in   					millimeters would it fit? Well it was perfect right down to   					the bolt holes. The steel had struts on it so two parts   					could be lifted at once. It took to about 1:30 to bolt the   					steel in place.<br />
        <br />
        The bridge then came on site being reversed down a steep   					hill on a big lorry this was a good bit of driving on the   					drivers part with only inches to spare. The bridge was split   					into two parts and lifted into place with no problems. It   					gives a good idea of what the new bridges will look like   					when its all finished. The next bridges for Burma Island are   					expected about 17th March <br />

        The wall around Burma island has been built for most of this   					week<br />
        <br />
        The second landmark bridge is to be installed at the   					historic Victorian, Queens Park, in Crewe next week.<br />
        <br />
        The bridge is 14.5 metres long and is supported by tubular   					steel with timber beams, decking walkway and handrails.<br />
        <br />
        Last month the very first bridge, Tipkinder, was installed   					to a fanfare of media and public attention and Coronation   					Bridge is promised to be even more impressive.<br />
        <br />
        The media are invited to witness this historic installation   					on Wednesday, February 17 from 12 noon. The installation is   					expected to last throughout the afternoon. Please come to   					the Tipkinder entrance off Queens Park Drive.<br />
        <br />
        Members of the public are also being encouraged to come   					along and witness history before their eyes. For those who   					want to get a close-up view please call the park manager,   					Elaine Dodd, on 01270 537896 so she can arrange a public   					viewing area.<br />
        <br />
        Works:<br />
        To allow these extensive works to be carried out, around two   					thirds of the park have been closed off to the public, but   					it&rsquo;s hoped that three quarters of the park will have been   					re-opened by the end of the year.<br />
        Other works in the pipeline include a planning application   					for replacement buildings, the largest of which is the new   					pavilion to replace the Jubilee Cafeteria built in the   					1970s.<br />
        <br />
        Modern in design, it will be made out of sandstone and glass   					to give customers impressive views over the park&rsquo;s grand   					grounds.<br />
        <br />
        Planning permission for a new bowling pavilion is currently   					under-way and designers are in talks with the Queens Park   					Bowling Club to get the best facility possible. Both   					buildings will have newly refurbished public toilets.<br />
        <br />
        Derek Morgan, Chairman of the Friends of Queens Park Group,   					said, &ldquo;Things will start to move very quickly during the   					Spring and Summer months. People will start to see a real   					difference as the Park is brought back to its former glory&rdquo;.<br />
        <br />
        The East and West lodges will also be improved and up-dated   					and there are plans for a &ldquo;Memorabilia Lounge&rdquo; at the West   					lodge.<br />
        <br />
        Councillor Roy Cartlidge, of the Crewe West Ward, who has   					supported the project throughout, added, &ldquo;The installation   					of the main bridges will be a significant part of the Park&rsquo;s   					history and are intended to last the next hundred years and   					beyond. &ldquo; </div>

      <p><strong>A nice little item for the past turned up at   				Queens Park thanks to Mrs Marjorie Taylor from Bedford Street.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Marjorie obtained this little treasure   				from Sam and Francis Buckingham&rsquo;s clearance shop, once situated   				on Nantwich Road, some 35 years ago.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>It&rsquo;s a small handbag mirror depicting a   				picture of Queens Park Lodges and the Clock Tower. We don&rsquo;t know   				what is was produced for or when and wonder if anyone else out   				there may have any information or anything similar? It&rsquo;s likely   				there will be a memorabilia room in the Lodge once the   				refurbishment is completed; so dig out those small items of   				treasure for anything you may wish to donate.</strong></p>
      <p>Its believed that there were also medal   				given out at the park<br />

        <p>The wall around the lake was started this week and you   					can see how much has been done already this week. The wall   					doesn't go all the way around as some of the lake has a soft   					edge. So all in all its a mad house with work going great   					guns and people can see the difference every day. As you can   					see the conditions are not ideal as there is a lot of water   					around from the snow which is hampering the work </p>

        At 10 o'clock today the new sluice bridge was on the back of   					a lorry from Huddersfield waiting to be list into position   					at the Tipkinder end of the lake. It took some time to get   					the crane right but at 1 o'clock the list began <br />

        <p> The crane lifted the bridge over our heads and swung it   					around into position. </p>
        <p>We were all surprised at the size of the bridge as it   					seemed a lot bigger than we had thought<br />

        <p>This was the first of the bridges which should have come   					in December but due to the snow and ice had to be put back.   					As a result of that they now intend to get the next 3   					bridges in in the next few weeks and they will be trying to   					do the three at once. Today's bridge is the small one so   					getting the other on site and in place should be a   					spectacular show.<br />
          <br />
          It was noticeable today that work was progressing at an   					alarming rate with work men everywhere, Burma island stone   					work had none at the front last week but yesterday they had   					the bottom layer in and today the next layer was going on.

        Arrival of First Bridge into Queens Park <br />
        Media Invite - Wednesday, January 27, 2010 at 10am<br />
        The first in a series of landmark bridges will be installed   					at Crewe&rsquo;s Queens Park next week, when the region&rsquo;s press is   					invited to record this historic moment. <br />
        Queens Park, the only formal park in Crewe, is more than 130   					years old and is currently undergoing a £6.5 million pound   					restoration, thanks to the Heritage Lottery Fund. <br />
        Altogether the 45-acre park will eventually house five   					bridges, the first of which is Tipkinder Bridge over the   					inlet at the entrance to the park. <br />
        It&rsquo;s the smallest of the five bridges at 7.3 metres in   					length and is made from timber and steel. <br />
        The most impressive structure will be Broadwalk Bridge,   					which will be 40 metres in length and will be unveiled later   					on this year. <br />
        Councillor Andrew Knowles, Cabinet Member with   					Responsibility for Parks, said: &ldquo;The installation of   					Tipkinder Bridge marks the beginnings of a new chapter in   					the history of Queens Park.<br />
        &ldquo;Since the 1870s, this wonderful public amenity – handed to   					the people of Crewe by the London and North Western Railway   					Company - has brought enjoyment to generations of Crewe   					families, and will continue to do so with a modern twist on   					the traditional Victorian park.&rdquo;<br />
        Works: <br />
        To allow these extensive works to be carried out, around two   					thirds of the park have been closed off to the public, but   					it&rsquo;s hoped that three quarters of the park will have been   					re-opened by the end of the year.<br />
        Other works in the pipeline include a planning application   					for replacement buildings, the largest of which is the new   					pavilion to replace the Jubilee Cafeteria built in the   					1970s.<br />
        <br />
        Modern in design, it will be made out of sandstone and glass   					to give customers impressive views over the park&rsquo;s grand   					grounds.<br />
        <br />
        Planning permission for a new bowling pavilion is currently   					under-way and designers are in talks with the Queens Park   					Bowling Club to get the best facility possible. Both   					buildings will have newly refurbished public toilets. <br />
        <br />
        Derek Morgan, Chairman of the Friends of Queens Park Group,   					said, &ldquo;Things will start to move very quickly during the   					Spring and Summer months. People will start to see a real   					difference as the Park is brought back to its former glory&rdquo;.<br />
        <br />
        The East and West lodges will also be improved and up-dated   					and there are plans for a &ldquo;Memorabilia Lounge&rdquo; at the West   					lodge. <br />
        <br />
        Councillor Roy Cartlidge, of the Crewe West Ward, who has   					supported the project throughout, added: &ldquo;The installation   					of the main bridges will be a significant part of the Park&rsquo;s   					history and are intended to last the next hundred years and   					beyond. &ldquo;<br />

        <p> The new pavilion design is finalized and presented here.   					Work will start around Easter time on the new pavilion which   					is highly energy efficient and can be divided into areas so   					it can be used for small groups<br />

        <p>It is designed to mimic the main entrance which has a   					lodge each side and the tower in the middle. The pavilion   					has the same two structures and the war memorial in the   					middle. Being mostly glass it will give a great view through   					it onto the lake<br />

        <p>The Boer war statue will be restored and the base will be   					dug out as the original footing are still there. This will   					mean people can then read the names of the fallen.<br />

        <p>What is interesting is there will be guns brought back   					like the original inn the picture above. But it will be   					interesting to see what we get the was a lot of   					controversial talk about the guns as at the time the guns   					used were not the type used in the Boer war and a lot of   					complaints were voiced at the time. So will we get Boer war   					guns or just old ones we will ask at the next meeting </p>

      I spotted the ducks in the snow and this one caught my eye its   				not our normal duck we get in the park. It looks like some sort   				of wood duck can anyone tell us what it is and is it rare in the   				Park?<br />
  <br />
      We have found out<br />
      The Duck is a Male <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/m/mandarin/index.aspx"> Mandarin</a>. Not all that rare but very nice to have in an   				urban park and not very often in this part of the world </div>
