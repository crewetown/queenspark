              <h5>The Queens Park is home to   				a lot of wildlife and we are seeking volunteers to help with the   				wildlife. The wildlife is slowly returning after the restoration   				and new wildlife appear all the time including Grebe, Heron,   				Jay, Cormorant King Fisher. We hope to build on this by creating   				a park that will attract wildlife by providing a favourable   				environment for them. A new group has formed to help with the   				wildlife and have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/"> Facebook page</a>.   				There has been a dedicated group of people who visit the park   				daily to feed the ducks and check on their needs for many years. </h5>
              <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Lz4pOnoWxqk/Uj9_lhMCoeI/AAAAAAAAKXg/QzZweXiNvlE/s1600-h/DSCF7322%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7322" alt="DSCF7322" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-EniQr7xkmVU/Uj9_mYWGztI/AAAAAAAAKXk/ddZ9-s7apFc/DSCF7322_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="158" width="212" /></a></p>
              <p>Our aim is to try to get more planting to encourage  a more   				diverse  wildlife population. Check on the wildlife recorded the   				wildlife ideally with pictures, educate people to look after and   				respect the wildlife and provide education to schools that visit   				the park. </p>
              <p>Anyone can join us  but we need photographers, people with   				knowledge of all sorts of wildlife and wildlife habitat and on   				occasion we will need muscle to complete some projects. People   				dont have to turn up at specific times but be able to come when   				they can make sure the wildlife is protected and yobs dont smash   				nests as has happened in the past when swan and grebe eggs have   				been destroyed. If you love wildlife this is the place to be we   				are also looking at Tipkinder Wood to see what can be done there   				as well <a href="http://www.crewetown.co.uk/inform.htm">contact   				us here</a>  </p>
              <p>The wildlife group who meet daily in the park to feed look   				after the wildlife have had a brilliant idea. The problems have   				been Grebe, Swans etc cant build nest close to the banks as they   				get smashed by yobs. We had success with a pallet next to the   				island, Some breed on the island but chicks fall off and cant   				jump back on and die. We noticed today a large dead tree next to   				Tipkinder bridge it will have to be felled if we then cut it   				into big logs and put them next to the islands wildlife will   				have somewhere to breed safely and a step to get back on the   				island. It just need them cutting so they are out of the water   				and dry on the top. Any more can go in the middle of the lake.   				The brilliant bit really is it GREEN, cost virtual nowt and   				could save money carting the tree away, its natural so wont look   				out of place and should last years. </p>

            A South Cheshire College Painting and Decorating   								student has helped to restore a plaque in   								Queen&rsquo;s Park to its former glory. </p>
          <p>Brad Hughes has completely stripped and   								repainted the metal plinth in memory of   								Councillor Charles Welch who played a key role   								in the park&rsquo;s history and heritage in the late   								1800s. </p>
          <p>The plaque commemorates a tree planted by   								Councillor Welch in the centre of the park but   								it went missing after being ripped up by   								vandals. </p>
          <p>It was retrieved from another part of the   								park but was in a bad state of repair before   								Brad stepped in to help out. </p>
          <p>The sign now looks sparkling after being   								painted black and white and will be put back in   								position alongside the tree. </p>
          <p>Four generations of Councillor Welch&rsquo;s family   								joined Cllr Brian Silvester and Queen&rsquo;s Park   								Manager Elaine Dodd to unveil the newly restored   								version at the West Lodge in Queen&rsquo;s Park. </p>
          <p>They included Councillor Welch&rsquo;s   								granddaughter June Kershaw, great granddaughter   								Anne Shaw and her husband Chris, great great   								granddaughter Charlotte Shaw and great great   								great granddaughter Lilly Massey. </p>
          <p>Brad Hughes and South Cheshire College   								Painting and Decorating tutor also met the   								family in Queen&rsquo;s Park. </p>
          <p>Brad, 17, of Crewe, who is studying a   								Painting and Decorating Level One Diploma, said:   								&ldquo;The plaque was in a bad state when I first saw   								it and it was very rusty but I stripped it down   								and repainted it. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;I think it looks a lot better now and I&rsquo;m   								glad the family and the park staff are pleased   								with it.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>The plaque reads &lsquo;This Tree was planted in   								memory of the late Councillor Welch in   								recognition of his valuable services as a member   								of the Park Committee. October 9th 1895. </p>
          <p>Cllr Brian Silvester said: &ldquo;The family   								contacted me when they realised that the plaque   								was missing. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;I contacted the Council, the plaque was   								found and the College agreed to refurbish it. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;We are extremely grateful to South Cheshire   								College for helping us to restore this plaque   								which has always held a prominent position at   								the heart of the park. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;This is a great example of partnership   								working and the newly restored version looks   								fantastic.&rdquo; </p>

          <p> The destruction continues in the park with the   								starling still roosting and making a right mess.   								You can see the trees near the bottom of the   								lake are white with mess and its feared some of   								these trees may not recover from the onslaught.

          <p>Over the week end the destruction continued   								in another form as vandals climbed on the cafe   								and bowls hut roofs pulling off lightening   								conductors and then proceeded to smash up one of   								the oldest bench's in the park and making  a   								mess of the bowling green while doing it.

The   								students will have devised science based   								activities to work on with the children in the   								park - appropriate to the age range of the   								children. This would then have the possibility   								of being followed up in the school early   								February.

                  <p>Crewe volunteer group the Queens Park ANTs   							(Actions Not Talk) received a huge boost during   							their latest action weekend when staff from Lloyds   							Bank lent a hand. </p>
                  <p>The park has already benefited from a number of   							initiatives led by the volunteers, and the final   							weekend of September saw them concentrate efforts   							clearing Coronation Walk.</p>
                  <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ckuXPbG2Ahk/Ukyi_hBuT5I/AAAAAAAAKh0/pVHjPHu9gho/s1600-h/DSCF7357%25255B5%25255D.jpg"><img title="DSCF7357" alt="DSCF7357" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ExNU3ffNndg/UkyjANXjAxI/AAAAAAAAKh8/-9LsdLEoiTI/DSCF7357_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="110" width="150" /></a></p>
                  <p>Over the next six months they hope to restore the   							old rockery area, introduce new planting and   							eventually reinstate the water feature that runs   							through the park to the lake. </p>
                  <p>ANTs coordinator Leanne Haythornthwaite was   							delighted to see the group&rsquo;s numbers increase. &ldquo;We   							saw a lot of new faces over the weekend, and having   							a national company involved is great news,&rdquo; she   							said. &ldquo;Most of the staff at the Crewe branch of   							Lloyds lives locally, so the park means a lot to   							them too. Having passionate local people working   							hard to make a difference is what our group is all   							about.&rdquo; </p>
                  <p>The Lloyds Banking Group runs a scheme called   							&ldquo;Day to make a difference&rdquo; where colleagues can   							volunteer their own time to a project of their   							choice. </p>
                  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way to really get involved with the local   							communities,&rdquo; explained Lloyds Project Manager Mark   							Ball. &ldquo;A lot of large organisations make donations   							and sponsor events, but Lloyds are determined to   							make a real difference by helping charities and   							community organisations like the ANTs.&rdquo; </p>
                  <p>Crewe branch manager Louise Harding is proud to   							be part of the initiative. &ldquo;The bank has a national   							target of giving one million voluntary hours by the   							end of 2015. It&rsquo;s important to the Crewe team that   							we play our part, so I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be joining the   							ANTs many times over the next couple of years.&rdquo; </p>
                  <p>The next ANTs volunteer action days at the park   							are scheduled for Saturday 26th October and Sunday   							1st December. </p>
                  <p>The problem this time of year as Autumn set in is   							that it needs cleaning weekly as leaves fall the   							Gulf War area and down by the boat house main path   							is bad again as the leave make a mess this is only a   							few weeks since it was cleaned  </p>
                  <p>Winter is on the way as the trees in the park   							start to change colour and this year its early as it   							was mid October last year. There are a lot of acorns   							on the trees which may be a sign of a bad winter. We   							do get some great colours from the trees and they   							vary week by week </p>

                <p>The three baby swans are growing   										nicely but they are in danger form   										illegal fishing last week the swan ad a   										hook in its mouth. This week kids fish   										under Burma Island bridge and as people   										throw bread for the duck the swans come   										and it was frightening to see them just   										missing the fishing line. The kids dont   										care about the wildlife so dont bother   										to pull the line in when lots of ducks   										geese and swans come to get food. Its a   										tragedy waiting to happen. We must get   										the Police to catch these kids and take   										them back to their parents as they just   										give verbal abuse if anyone else says   										anything to them </p>

          <p> The Canadian Geese have some new babies but there is   							no sign of any ducks having babies yet. Last year we   							had seen them by this time so they are well behind   							this year. Some babies were still appearing last   							year in June so there is time yet but there isnt any   							platforms this year for them to nest on as all the   							ones that were put in the lake have sank so the   							Grebe cant breed as they cant walk on land. There is   							nothing else happening in the park at the moment and   							its hard to do updates when no improvements are   							being done and all the action is around kids fishing   							and dogs off the lead.</p>

          <p> The starling have been making a mess of the trees   							near the lake for a while they all smell and it has   							been slowly killing the trees the wind chopped in   							and destroyed a lot of the branch's the birds had   							ruined.

          <p>There is get together to discuss Friends Group   							Activities and Fund Raising before the season gets   							under way. </p>

          <p>The tufted duck is a medium-sized diving duck,   							smaller than a mallard. It is black on the head,   							neck, breast and back and white on the sides. It has   							a small crest and a yellow eye. In flight it shows   							an obvious white stripe across the back of the wing.   							It breeds in the UK across lowland areas of England,   							Scotland and Ireland, but less commonly in Wales,   							with most birds being residents. Numbers increase in   							the UK in winter because of birds moving to the UK   							from Iceland and northern Europe. </p>

          <p> I took the enclosed photographs earlier this evening   							from Moreton Road in Crewe. Thousands of starlings   							were flocking and performing their aerial ballet   							overhead in readiness for roosting in the nearby   							Queens Park. I'd recommend taking an umbrella if   							your wanting to watch though, as otherwise you might   							get a different kind of eyeful! Jonathan White,   							Crewe</p>

                    <p>Willaston and Rope Ward UKIP Councillor Brian Silvester is   				calling on the Cheshire East Council to get their act together   				over Queens Park Crewe. </p>
                    <p>He said,&quot; It is beyond belief that over £7m has been spent   				but, several years after, Queens Park is still not finished.(See   				below and attached) Basic requirements, like accessible   				footpaths to allow people to walk around the park, have not been   				provided. Many of the footpaths have not been finished off and   				the west end of the lake has had no footpaths for over two   				years. It is incredible that almost four times as much has been   				spent on consultants compared to the amount spent on   				footpaths.(See below)On one of the pavilions (which cost a total   				of £1.6m) there still isn't any downspout so the water wets you   				as you walk under the veranda.(See attached photo) </p>
                    <p>Since the ill conceived redundancy of the Park Wardens, there   				has been an increased level of lawlessness in the park. Kids on   				bikes, copious levels of litter, repeated criminal damage,   				motorbikes being ridden across the lake bridge and dog owners   				encouraging their dogs to attack waterfowl. </p>
                    <p>The park needs to be finished off properly and it needs to be   				policed efficiently. The original intention was to return the   				park to its former glory but urgent action is now needed if that   				is to be achieved.&quot; </p>

                    <p>Dear Cllr Silvester, </p>
                    <p>Actual Expenditure to date on the Queens Park Project is   				£7,312,304.96. </p>
                    <p>two weeks later the cost from a FOI request are £7,599,277.00 </p>
                    <p>From the Friends of QP mins Chris Lawton has re-measured the   				pathways and received some budget costing's – the value to   				complete works is around £500K, which is a big improvement on   				the £2mill figure quoted elsewhere. The cost via FOI is now   				£382,000.00 that's a few weeks later. So one may well ask why   				the discrepancy in these figures so the latest is £7.5 million   				with other things still want doing like coronation walk Burma   				Island </p>
                    <p> </p>

                    <p>Above the bowls hut now has CCTV but if you look at the photo   				you can see that the water still falls on your head as there are   				no down spots. It was supposed to be a posh chain but years   				later its still not finished.</p>

                    <p>The tree cut down from startling damage are having there   				stumps removed but they seem to be struggling with it as they   				have tried for a couple of days without much progress.</p>

                    <p>The dangerous path at the bottom of the lake has been closed.   				It is deadly to walk on as there is water either side and its   				just a mud bath and this weather if it freezes your going in the   				lake and there is no life belts any more as they were removed   				not a good idea given they have allowed fishing should have been   				risk assessed. </p>

                  We would have expected the public to   										have their say on the matter of fishing   										as it effects their safety and the lives   										of the wildlife as swans have been   										hooked up last year. People I have spoke   										to and I am in the park every day dont   										believe it will be safe for people to   										walk near the lake if fishing is going   										on. If you fish with a 12 ft rod from   										the fisherman you need 12 ft clear all   										around you plus the line in many cases   										this isnt possible as its to close to   										paths and therefore people are in danger   										of being hocked up.
                  <p>The public have no   										say one what goes on in the Queens Park,   										its supposed to be the peoples park but   										their opinion is not worth anything and   										no one is listening to public opinion   										its all done behind their backs <br />
                    See the statements below the first   										statement was from Cllr Jones and also   										printed in the Chronicle the email below   										proves someone is lying and also that   										the friends have no effect on the   										decisions local officers make and as   										such it&rsquo;s a waste of everyone&rsquo;s time if   										the officers then do what the hell they   										want without any one from the public   										getting their opinion considered and the   										fishing has now been rushed through   										before anyone can object.</p>

                    We cant believe Cllr Jones has made the   										statement knowing it to be false so what   										going on? Some facts. There has been   										illegal fishing in the park with kids   										and other fishing with no licence and no   										permission they claim they couldn&rsquo;t stop   										it. <br />
                    The wardens are in the office in the   										park daily and the only time they have   										walk 3 mins to the lake and stopped   										fishing is when I have got them out of   										the office. The Environment Agency will   										enforce illegal fishing by issuing a   										£2500 fine get a few people with a fine   										and word will get around very quick</p>
                  <p><br />
                    It clear the Friends Group and ANTS   										weren&rsquo;t  consulted as was stated. Its   										stated the Friends have now power and as   										such what is there role if no one   										listens to them or public opinion?<br />
                    As the Club is run by an individual who   										is collecting the money and were is it   										going if it&rsquo;s the club then it&rsquo;s a   										company has the man registered the fact   										and if he is on any sort of benefits   										like housing benefit advised them of his   										income and paying tax? As he has   										bailiffs acting for him as volunteers   										that may be working with children have   										they all been CRB checked?  <br />
                    <strong>They say having responsible   										fishermen will help in the first week   										they have blocked paths, left rods un   										attended fished not on pegs so these are   										no better than the kids were are the   										bailiffs?</strong></p>

                  <p>Above every fisherman knows you dont   										leave your rod in the water unattended   										as if a fish bites it can drag the rod   										into the water and be injured note its   										fishing not on a peg and blocking the   										narrow path as well <a target="_blank" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/31469.aspx"> its also unlawful</a> to do this, so   										much for good fishermen setting an   										example he also didnt use a public   										toilet but exposed himself in the park</p>

                  <p>Above can anyone seriously tell me   										this is safe the path its self is a   										death trap so lets make more dangerous   										by letting people fish there and block   										the path who did the risk assessment on   										this.</p>
                  <p><br />
                    We have requested details of the club,   										risk assessment, rules details of   										meetings and despite asking several time   										they have not been forthcoming what are   										they hiding? Pictures of the pegs on a   										two foot wide slippery muddy path show   										they haven&rsquo;t done a risk assessment as   										its very dangerous to walk the path and   										having someone fishing makes it down   										right dangerous when pointed out to them   										they refused to comment.</p>
                  <p><br />
                    Some pegs are close to the bridge and   										this area is like a motorway for   										wildlife so the chances of killing   										wildlife is very high plus people feed   										them off the bridge and they could be   										caught as well.</p>
                  <p><br />
                    The Friends mins show the club was to   										start in January but they have rushed it   										through and fishing is now taking place   										why? <br />
                    Procedure and safe guards are needed if   										wildlife get hooked up this involves   										cutting the line and calling the RSPCA   										none of this is in place.  <br />
                    The fishing club has been made a member   										of the friends no vote proposed or   										seconded  the Friends mins state The   										group will be affiliated into the   										Friends Constitution – likewise the ANTs.   										So how can officers FORCE this on   										friends against the constitution are   										the  friends group there as a political   										weapon controlled by officers? So what   										is the future for the friends if they   										cant speak for the public and effect   										decisions then they may as well disband. </p>

                  <p><strong><br />
                  </strong>There are reports of alleged   										cyber bullying by a member of ANTS and   										the friends and this person has three   										complaints and allegedly forced one   										person of Facebook  with the bullying,   										he has also told this person that the   										ANTs are moving the Burma island and   										Boar war memorials greatly upsetting   										this person and causing problems for   										many people.

                    I thank you for your email.<br />
                    The decision to support fishing in the   										park has been taken via the two public   										groups who so brilliantly support the   										park.</p>
                  <p>It is the friends of the park and   										Ants who have recommended this and it is   										they who believe it is the right thing   										to do.</p>
                  <p>I think you should petition these   										excellent people, who work tirelessly to   										improve the park and then the council   										will follow the majority view.</p>
                  <p>The council is merely following the   										views of the majority of local people   										who represent the park.</p>
                  <p>It is there suggestion not the   										council and I resent your attacking of   										your council without full knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Please contact these groups to   										discuss and the council will follow the   										majority view.</p>

                    Subject: RE: Fishing in queens park</p>
                  <p>Fishing has always been a popular   										activity at Queens Park. It was   										temporarily stopped whilst the lake was   										reconstructed and then for a period to   										allow the fish stocks to recover after   										relocation back into the water. It was   										always the clear intention that angling   										would be restarted and this has been   										stated to the many people who have   										enquired over recent years. The   										intention to reintroduce angling has   										been raised at the meetings of the <strong>Friends Group simply as a means   										of gauging their opinion and keeping   										them informed</strong>. <strong>It is   										not the Friends Group&rsquo;s role to formally   										make decisions on the</strong> management of the park but to give the   										community a voice in this process. We   										have excellent working relations with   										the Friends Group who play a large role   										in guiding our decision making.<br />
                    Angling does have its critics but it is   										also one of the most popular   										recreational activities in Britain   										today. At its best it is a tremendous   										way of building inter-generational   										cooperation as older anglers teach young   										people to fish. However, when   										uncontrolled it does lead to the   										problems as stated below. As managers of   										the park we have to make judgements   										about such issues. In this case it is   										our judgement that fishing will occur   										whether we sanction it or not as we do   										not have the resources to enforce a ban.   										By creating a new Queens Park Angling   										Club, attached to the Friends Group and   										run by some enthusiastic volunteers, we   										are trying to manage the activity and   										thus minimise any problems. It will   										bring more responsible adults into the   										park which will help protect the park in   										many ways. We have stated that we intend   										to review the situation again during the   										close season (Spring 2014).  <br />
                    I hope this is helpful  <br />

            <p>The Fiends constitution says </p>
            <p>Aims and Objectives <br />
              To promote the restoration (i,) capturing Queens   							Park&rsquo;s Victorian splendour, conservation and   							enhancement of Queens Park in Crewe, for the benefit   							of residents, <strong>visitors, wildlife</strong> and fish. We   							believe that this is not met if fishing goes ahead   							as the majority don&rsquo;t want it and its clear its not   							in the interest of Wildlife. </p>
            <p>represent the views of the residents of Crewe and   							other regions of the Cheshire East Council, in   							matters concerning the Park, This isn&rsquo;t being met as   							the fishing wasn&rsquo;t agreed by the committee and <strong>residents view were not sought on this   							matter</strong>. Its interesting that Cllr M Grant   							stated today she is having nothing to do with   							fishing, I hope she will then resign as a cllr as   							she is paid to put residents views forward the fact   							she comes in the park with her own dog never on a   							lead setting a fine example to others has been   							raised before. </p>
            <p>The Committee <br />
              The &lsquo;Core/Officers&rsquo; Committee shall consist of a   							Chairperson, Secretary, Fund Raising Officer,   							Treasurer and Parks Manager and any other such   							Officers as the <strong>Friends of the Park</strong> group may   							from time to time decide. Another big one as mins   							from the last meeting show that ANTS and Fishing are   							now part of this but FRIENDS were not given an   							option to vote on this so that is dictatorship not   							democracy. As the constitution hasn&rsquo;t been followed   							in creating the fishing club it must be considered   							as null and void. </p>
            <p>From mins </p>
            <p>ANGLING<br />
              <strong>Several meeting</strong> have taken place with Angling   							Clubs. As a result, an independent QP<br />
              Angling Club is to be established by January 2014.<br />
              The group will be affiliated into the Friends   							Constitution – likewise the ANTs.<br />
              Activities&rsquo; will include Youth sessions and   							initiatives to care and improve the waters and   							wildlife/fowl. </p>

            <p>Above who thinks this is safe the fishing pegs   							are in an area less than 2 ft wide that is passable   							so how can anyone safely walk around the lake?</p>

            <p>Fishing is still illegal in the park but its   							started all ready click on the picture then look at   							the path you cant get past as its blocked by   							fishermen's rubbish </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>There has been no progress on the fishing and the   							council and other officials are refusing to say who   							agreed to the fishing club so we have put in a   							Freedom of Information request which by law they   							must answer. Things have got worse as the pegs have   							now gone in and its clear that they must be brain   							dead to put them were they have in the picture you   							can see they are on the muddy path less than 2 feet   							wide at the bottom of the lake. So once they fish   							there it will be impassable and dangerous to anyone   							who try&rsquo;s. They have put some near the bridge and   							this is the main swim for all wildlife and therefore   							not safe for wildlife fortunately the Environmental   							Agency can take action on this as the park has had   							wildlife hooked before its considered a blackspot   							area and they can come in at anyone request and   							check the pegs don&rsquo;t cover any swims and if they do   							they can remove the pegs. This can be changed at any   							time as new wildlife come in the park or start a   							nest. </p>
            <p>The park and club must carry out a risk   							assessment and they demonstrate by the placement of   							the pegs that this isn&rsquo;t the case as its clear its   							dangerous. </p>
            <p>Risk assessment  standard practice   across most   							councils in the uk include no under 16 year old cant   							fish alone and must  have an adult present at all   							times, </p>
            <p>RISK OF INFECTION (e.g. weils disease,  cross   							contamination from having touched bait, fish,   							discarded unused bait, water born algae). So there   							must be provision to wash hands. </p>
            <p>  RISK OF INJURY: e.g. stings and bites from   							insects attracted to water and bait.  Stings from   							plants etc. Poisonous plants.  Therefore a   							registered first aider should be on site when anyone   							is fishing.  Life Belts are not present in the park   							so they should be provided in case of anyone falling   							in the lake. </p>
            <p>They must have emergency procedure in place if   							wildlife get hooked up a</p>

          <div id="post-body-6493453529706164555" itemprop="description articleBody"> We believe that&rsquo;s swans and wildlife will die at the   							Queens Park as a new fishing club has been started   							from January. In the period of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/06/swan-injured-by-fishing-line.html"> a month a Swan</a>, a baby swan and a duck have   							suffered horrendous injures from being hooked by   							illegal fishing. The swan couldn&rsquo;t raise its head or   							eat for days until the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/08/baby-swan-injured-in-queens-park-again.html"> RSPCA  rescued it</a>. There has been problems with   							illegal fishing for a long time with them causing   							criminal damage, fishing without a rod licence   							skipping school to fish and riding through the park   							with 15 ft rods on bikes with line and hooks    							swinging about.
            <p><br />
              There has on average only been 5-10 daily doing this   							but the fishing club are to have 27 pegs its not   							clear how many rods per peg but a lot allow 3 rods   							that equates to 90 lines in the lake. Simple maths   							tells us if you have a lot of swans ducks etc and 90   							lines some are going to be hooked up. There are   							special problems on the lake, we have Grebes and   							other wildlife that swim under water for great   							distances and would be unseen by fishermen until    							its to late and as they are protected birds a fine   							of several thousand pounds could happen. The other   							problem is as soon as you go near the lake all the   							swans and duck come thinking you have bread for   							them.</p>
            <p><br />
              What has caused problems and letter of complaints in   							the press is how this has been done in secret. I am   							on the friends committee and we new discussions were   							taking place with fishing groups and we would then   							expect to here proposals on fishing for us to   							discuss and raise any objections to. We would also   							expect the public to be able to have a say in this   							as 98% of people visiting the park come to see or   							feed the ducks many come daily and know each duck by   							name. These people have come to the park for many   							years on a daily basis in winter and summer to care   							for the ducks.</p>
            <p><br />
              What has happened is that secret meeting have taken   							place as I and at least two other members of the   							committee were not told about these meeting or given   							the opportunity to go along we don&rsquo;t know who   							attended these meeting or when they took place. The   							first we knew was kids at the skate park told us   							committee members that it had been agreed and would   							start in January. So who ever went to these meeting   							and they are refusing to name these people have made   							a decision for everyone that visits the park without   							the friends or member of the public been given the   							opportunity to object. It was discussed at the last   							friends meeting but not as an option to vote on but   							as a<strong> DONE DEAL</strong> it had been passed   							by these mysterious people. Apart from anything else   							democracy says that users of the park should be   							consulted and given an opportunity to put their case   							forward  but it seems we have a dictatorship in the   							park. This week its fishing what will be passed   							behind closed doors next week?</p>
            <p><br />
              This is the letter sent to the papers others have   							also been sent<br />
              Dear Editor,<br />
              I am a regular visitor of Queens Park and have been   							so for many years. Apparently, as from January 2014,   							fishing will be allowed in the park, seemingly a   							decision made behind closed doors. I am filled with   							utter dismay. It reinforces my view that Cheshire   							East Council treats members of the public visiting   							the park with utter contempt. The West end of the   							lake has had no footpaths for over two years since   							the ridiculous re-opening of the unfinished park   							&quot;ceremony&quot;, the Council have made no attempt   							whatsoever of remedying this with a low cost   							temporary solution. Additionally, since the ill   							conceived redundancy of the park Wardens, there has   							been an increasing level of lawlessness in the park.   							Kids on bikes, copious levels of litter, criminal   							damage. In the past year alone,<br />
              I have witnessed motorbikes being ridden across the   							lake bridge, and dog owners encouraging their dogs   							to attack waterfowl. And now it would seem that   							because the Council have been unable or unwilling to   							stop the unauthorised fishing in the park, there is   							a proposal to allow a fishing club to   							organise/regulate fishing in the park commencing in   							January. <br />
              I believe the park is an inappropriate site for this   							sort of activity for a multitude of reasons. Which   							include: <br />
              a) Health and Safety issues: Line casting near/on   							public footpaths. Absolute no brainer this one   							surely. <br />
              b) Paths, (Public Access): This should be pretty   							obvious too. For example, the public will be   							expected to walk through mud, or     wade through   							the gigantic puddle at the aforementioned west end   							of the lake to circumnavigate those fishing on the   							lake     edge until the paths (missing or   							inaccessible since 2007!), are installed in the   							Spring.<br />
              c) Wildlife: To me, this is the most important.   							Numerous families bring their children to the park   							to see or feed the Swans, Ducks     or Geese. There   							WILL BE continued incidents of waterfowl injuries   							due to this activity. In the last few months alone,   							the RSPCA     have had to come to the rescue of the   							Signets and a Duck several times, due to fishing   							line or pellet. This surely is unacceptable.     The   							lake is their home, and priority should be given to   							the majority of people who come to the park to enjoy   							the wildlife.<br />
              d) Everyone I have spoken to is of the opinion that   							the vast majority of people would be against   							allowing fishing in the Park.     Therefore, if this   							permission goes ahead, against the wishes of most   							people, serious questions would have to be answered.   							It is true that fishing was once permitted in the   							park many years ago, but that does not make it   							right, after all, cigarettes were once freely   							advertised on TV.<br />
              I urge the Council to have a rethink, or to conduct   							a proper and fair survey, listening to the views of   							people who visit the park. Negative publicity and   							public petitions against this proposal will surely   							follow if these people&rsquo;s views are ignored.</p>
            <p><br />
              He raise some good points mainly on safety as one   							old lady has been hooked up with fishing hook if   							they are using 15 ft polls and a lot do an area of   							15ft all around the fisherman can be a danger area   							as they cast and as often this area will encroach on   							public paths there is a danger of children or dogs   							etc can be hooked up with careless casting. The   							clubs say they will have bailiffs but no one is   							going to come and sit there every day for 12 hours   							so that just isn&rsquo;t going to work. I have asked for    							the location of the pegs but so far that has not   							been forthcoming but from what we can see it will   							all be at the bottom of the lake and to get that   							many in it will block some of the footpaths or put   							people in danger.</p>
            <p><strong>Cllr Jones</strong><br />
              This has now raised other questions about the park   							as Cllr Jones was informed incorrectly that the   							friends and ANTS had all recommended the fishing but   							this isn&rsquo;t he case no vote was taken its your having   							it like it or not.<strong> Members of the ANTS   							confirmed today they didn&rsquo;t know about the meeting   							with fishing clubs and no idea who went or any   							detail like were pegs will be, they certainly have   							not recommended it</strong>. Part of the problem   							seems to be that no one could be bothered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/06/the-queens-park-is-like-wild-west.html"> to stop illegal fishing</a> so to pass the buck to a   							club means they wont have to do anything and can   							blame the club if anything goes wrong this could be   							a legal issue as well that the club may be liable   							for any injury.</p>
            <p><br />
              The Dog wardens and community wardens have office in   							the park but refuse to patrol it as they claims its   							not down to them and when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/04/dangerous-dog-attack-puppy-jax-in.html"> dogs attack the refuse to</a> act see here. Again   							they have made very little effort to stop the   							fishing and on one occasion a council officer was   							shown people illegally fishing and told me to go an   							sort it out and refused to do anything himself.</p>
            <p><br />
              <strong>Cllr Jones Steps in</strong><br />
              Problems with the park have all been blamed on CEC   							but now evidence suggest they  may not be the main   							problem.   After representation to Cllr Jones and he   							studied some other complaints he has taken action.   							It was pointed out to him that for instance a tree   							was cut down and the stump ground down and the   							rubbish left in a pile by the lake in August  then   							the ANTS cleaned the boat house and added their   							rubbish to it that was over a month ago. The rubbish   							then with the wind and rain spread all over the path   							making it a safety issue so the total time it had   							been there is over 3 months. Its not a big job or   							costing thousands to remove. Dangerous trees were   							reported in Tipkinder woodland  well before October   							and reported here <a href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/10/queenspark-wildlife-group-action-plan.html"> http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/10/queenspark-wildlife-group-action-plan.html</a>.   							Nothing was done about those even though they were a   							danger.<br />
              Another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2013/10/scouts-weekend.html"> dangerous tree over 30 ft tall</a> in the park next   							to the road was reported and no action taken until I   							personally told the tree men in the town and they   							came and inspected it and took it down off their own   							bat as its was so dangerous. On both occasions this   							was recorded on Facebook and acknowledged  but no   							action was taken, mysteriously all these comments   							have now disappeared from Facebook so evidence has   							been destroyed WHY?</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-v8t0iiLj0j4/UoAhm90U3qI/AAAAAAAAKwE/qbOb_wJ8abQ/s1600-h/DSCF7501%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7501" alt="DSCF7501" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-e70w4bV2n8g/UoAhniaGG3I/AAAAAAAAKwI/20gKK6lG1H0/DSCF7501_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="397" width="529" /></a></p>
            <p>Above one of over 10 ten dangerous trees felled   							after Cllr Jones stepped in.</p>
            <p> <br />
              Cllr Jones once he knew took immediate action and   							with 12 hours the rubbish was removed and the trees   							have now been felled. But here is another one for   							him recorded before anyone can  hide it. The rubbish   							from the tree stumps there is another pile that has   							been by the café from august but more importantly in   							August it was reported that there was a hole in the   							path by the lake. Surprise surprise its still there   							as you can see in the photo taken today it is very   							deep and I was nearly up to my knee in the hole.   							When I poked a 2 ft stick in it disappeared  into   							mud and the path if you are heavy and walk on it   							collapses. I am no expert but it seems there is a   							very good chance that the sewer or drain under the   							path could make the path total collapse in to the   							drain along with anyone who stood on it. Again this   							is a serious safety issue the whole as it is could   							easily break someone&rsquo;s leg or worse.<br />
              It is not Cllr Jones job to organize work in the   							park but that is what he is having to do at the   							moment. He has promise to look into the fishing   							problem and move forward plants for the lake and   							wildlife. So with his help things are moving in the   							right direction <br />
            </p>

            <p> ANTs storm into action </p>
            <p>Crewe&rsquo;s Queens Park ANTs (Actions Not Talk)   							volunteers were busy again in late October working   							hard before the winter sets in. </p>
            <p>Following several successful working weekends   							over the summer months, the team tackled overgrown   							bamboo along Coronation Walk, fallen branches by the   							bandstand, and painted stone edges by the lodges. </p>
            <p>They also responded to calls from parents who had   							asked for the play area to be cleared of leaves,   							pine cones and horse chestnut cases. </p>
            <p>With a wet autumn already affecting some paths   							and much of the park&rsquo;s play equipment, the ANTs   							cleared debris ready for collection by the Cheshire   							East Council staff.  Lets hope the leaves are given   							to gardeners as they are great compost </p>
            <p>The ANTs meet again on Sunday 1st December.   							Contact <a href="mailto:queensparkants@homail.com"> queensparkants@homail.com</a> for more information. </p>

            <h6><br />
              Join us on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/"> https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/</a><br />
              The aim of the group is to protect and encourage the   							wildlife in the park. Most members are people who   							visit the park daily to care for the wildlife and   							have done this for years. We have taken expert   							advice from RSPB, Cheshire Wildlife Trust. Sandbach   							Woodland and Wildlife Trust and our own expert   							members. We are also looking at Tipkinder wood as   							this is the start of the wildlife corridor feeding   							the park any problems there could affect the park   							via the brook.</h6>
            <h6><br />
              The main   							problems stem from yobs destroying eggs and nest of   							protected birds like swans and grebe on many   							occasions. To combat this there need to be ramps or   							logs are needed all around the two main islands so   							they can nest away from danger this need to be a   							long term placement and backed up by planting of   							reed beds round the islands. A lot of more hens nest   							on the island and then the babies fall off and cant   							get back on and die so some sort of ramp is needed   							to then can get back on. All this needs to be done   							well before breeding season. Read beds are needed to   							form a natural habitat. All plants will help the   							wildlife which includes the fish so the angling club   							may want input into this and it will benefit the   							lake as well. As we have had two swans and duck   							injured by fishing line we are keen to see the   							wildlife protected from this in the future. </h6>
            <h6><br />
              Suggested planting along part of the edge of the   							lake - a fringe of reed mace, yellow flag iris,   							meadowsweet and other wetland plants would create a   							habitat for many creatures as well as birds (N.B.   							reed-mace can spread rapidly, however it cannot move   							into deep water, so it should be OK in the lake.<br />
              The two steep   							banks of grass either side of Burma island on the   							south side are never used as they are to steep and   							are hard to mow so we want to make them into   							wildlife meadows this would help wildlife and reduce   							the need for regular mowing. They could be used for   							fishing as it doesn&rsquo;t put people in danger when   							walking past while people are casting. Possibly the   							area by the main road that is a bank on the north   							side could have the same treatment.</h6>
            <h6><br />
              To encourage   							wildlife we need to start at the bottom of the food   							chain by putting lots of compost areas and rotting   							log piles this needs to be balanced with not looking   							a mess so it&rsquo;s a matter of agreeing areas in bushes   							that wont generally be seen for these we are talking   							small piles which will barley be seen not huge ones.   							Other discreet project are log piles and bee hotels   							again discreetly situated to benefit things like   							hedgehogs etc. This will fit in with school projects   							that Ben runs and we would help with an educational   							resource <br />
              More plants are   							required for wildlife which would include. More bird   							boxes are also needed and our members are putting up   							bird feeders to feed birds through the winter.<br />
              • Spring:   							flowering currant, Berberis, Forsythia, guelder   							rose.<br />
              • Summer: Hebe,   							lavender, honeysuckle, elder<br />
              • Autumn: Buddleja,   							heather, Hypericum, Fatsia<br />
              • Winter: Mahonia,   							ivy, witch hazel, Sarcococca<br />
              Tipkinder wood   							Myself and Jules Hornbrook looked at the wood a few   							years ago <br />
              <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crewetown.co.uk%2Ftipkinder.htm&amp;h=LAQEiTDsDAQHs68y7rHpaq-vg0uA5QFW5VNv7MbQIsGB17w&amp;s=1"> http://www.crewetown.co.uk/tipkinder.htm</a><br />
            Tipkinder wood has been left for many years and we   							propose to remove lots of self seeded saplings to   							allow for more low growing bushes to be planted for   							wildlife and make the area more pleasant we can do   							most of the work but some large trees that are close   							to each other want removing and these we would look   							to cut into large logs as seats by the stream as   							it&rsquo;s a lovely place to sit on a hot sunny day. There   							is a real danger in the wood as its not been managed   							for years and many of the trees have fallen or have   							been damaged and liable to fall at any time in high   							winds this is a serious H&amp;S issue as some trees are   							30ft and could cause injury or damage if they fall   							and the Council could be liable.</h6>

            <h6>Above two 30 ft   							trees have fallen which will knock down more<br />
              The cost of all   							this is very small the most expensive being the   							plants for the lake the rest requires very little   							expenditure. Tipkinder would require the tree   							experts to cut down larger trees and make the area   							safe. Removal of saplings volunteers could do and   							being a wildlife wood the bio degradable waste can   							be left on site for wildlife. Any type of plants   							would be suitable to bring life to lower areas and a   							appeal for bring an old plant to the wood day may   							fund that. All this would be done in conjunction   							with other groups like Friends, Ants, Fishing club,   							and schools <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/queensparkwildlife"> #queensparkwildlife</a></h6>

            <h6>The RSPB have issued a warning   							about birds most of the seeds they eat at this time   							of year are not ripe so they want supplementing with   							bird seed etc. So we need more bird feeders put by   							the Tipkinder entrance to the park on the left   							through the gates then hanging anywhere around there   							and our members will keep them filled. So if you   							have any spare of any sort pop them along help the   							birds this winter</h6>

            <p> We had three baby swans born in July but now we are   							down to just one 2 have mysteriously disappeared the   							last one to go is the weak one above and its been   							gone a week now. The chances of a fox or similar   							getting 2 swans when the parents are about and lots   							of other ducks to choose from must be a million to   							one.We suspect that they may have been taken. The   							last one was week and its possible that it could   							have swallowed lead shot from illegal fishing. We   							have searched the park for a body or evidence of an   							attack but no signs of it.</p>

            <p> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/"> <strong>Wildlife Facebook Page</strong></a></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We have started a new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/"> Facebook Group for Wildlife in the park</a> to   							ensure the wildlife are considered in the park and   							future planting is done to encourage new wildlife to   							come to the park. Plants are needed in the lake   							which was part of the original plan to provide   							nesting areas food etc for wildlife, ramps up to the   							island are also needed as often wildlife breads on    							the islands as  its safe  but then baby moorhens etc   							cant get back on to safety once they leave. Places   							near the islands need to be constructed so duck   							swans can breed in safety away from vandals. The   							diversity of wildlife is slowly growing as the park   							get back to normal but more needs to be done to   							encourage buttery flies, birds etc to come to the   							park. Wildlife is not considered when planning   							things for the park as an example the islands have a   							overhang that stops them getting on to it.</p>
            <p>We are seeking volunteers to help look after   							wildlife record whats seen so people know what to   							look for the following years etc. A dedicated group   							feed the ducks on a daily basis but we need to   							educate people what food to give instead of white   							bread.</p>
            <h5>Good Foods for Ducks</h5>
            <p>The best foods for ducks are those that provide   							the nutrients, minerals and vitamins the birds need   							for healthy growth and development. Many of these   							foods are similar to the natural seeds, grains and   							plants the birds will <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/Bird-Glossary-E-G/g/Forage.htm"> forage</a> on their own. As <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/birdingglossary/g/Omnivorous.htm"> omnivorous</a> birds, ducks will eat a great deal of   							different foods, and the best foods to offer ducks   							include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/Foods/a/Cracked-Corn.htm"> Cracked corn</a></li>
              <li>Wheat, barley or similar grains </li>
              <li>Oats (uncooked; rolled or quick) </li>
              <li>Rice (cooked or uncooked) </li>
              <li>Milo </li>
              <li>Birdseed (any type or mix) </li>
              <li>Grapes (cut in half) </li>
              <li>Frozen peas or corn (defrosted, no need to   								cook) </li>
              <li>Earthworms </li>

              <li>Vegetable trimmings or peels (chopped) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Duck feed pellets or poultry starter pellets are   							another great option, and they can be purchased from   							farming or agricultural supply stores. </p>

            <p>Having talked to people who like myself visit the   							park everyday we have put together a master plan of   							what needs addressing in the park. Many people will   							visit the park once a week or once a month and can   							have different experiences depending on various   							factors. People who visit daily see a lot more and   							understand what goes on at all times of the day. </p>
            <p><strong>Restoration</strong></p>
            <p>Below the Monkey Hut restored a few months ago   							and the floor is now cracked and dangerous and its   							only time before kids pull it up </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-2rLa2KR1nr0/Uiu3dB61kxI/AAAAAAAAKQI/MG6t8hsdAJU/s1600-h/DSCF7310%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7310" alt="DSCF7310" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UQng6zZH0B0/Uiu3dzk1H6I/AAAAAAAAKQM/3ESMBmZHO7U/DSCF7310_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="400" width="533" /></a></p>
            <p>Everyone agrees that the park needs to be   							finished but there is little we can do about that as   							its down to the council do it but we could raise   							money from local companies to help. What is   							important that people get a say on what is done and   							don&rsquo;t turn up one day and find something they   							disagree with. Some smaller projects could be done   							by ANTS but a lot its down to a partnership with the   							council. </p>
            <p>Below the clock once again isnt working even   							after the restoration</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-e67cdmZTWzk/Uiu3er65hCI/AAAAAAAAKQY/v3VVYQRtIRo/s1600-h/DSCF8581%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF8581" alt="DSCF8581" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Lh4PMkksdtw/Uiu3fDbpaeI/AAAAAAAAKQc/vfhWTCZs-c4/DSCF8581_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="396" width="528" /></a></p>
            <p><strong>Cleaning and look of the park.</strong></p>
            <p>This is an on going problem some caused by nature   							other caused by litter and the public. Its not a one   							off problem but a daily or weekly problem and needs   							work doing on a regular basis. Droppings for the   							geese can soon make a mess of paths and this can   							happen daily. Due to lack of staff this is being   							done by volunteers and ANTS did a wonderful job at   							their weekend clean up. The problem is getting   							people doing this on a regular basis as some times   							of the year it can get worse ie winter when there   							are lots of leaves and people don&rsquo;t want to go out. </p>
            <p>Below ANTS did a wonderful job of cleaning this   							path but 3 days later its a mess its almost a daily   							chore that wants doing </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-7b3k_syzyZs/Uiu3gK2aaWI/AAAAAAAAKQo/40gOhw_fJKs/s1600-h/DSCF7313%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7313" alt="DSCF7313" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-7BmbJKrNLbs/Uiu3hFRrODI/AAAAAAAAKQs/VqckNW7Beks/DSCF7313_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="390" width="520" /></a></p>
            <p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
            <p>At the moment we don&rsquo;t have set projects for   							anyone volunteering we need a list of project that   							people can work on so a volunteer can come along and   							choose from a large list of projects that match   							their skills and interest. These list need to be   							well designed for instance refurbishing the lodge   							gardens the list would have to include exactly what   							the plan is so people would know what they can and   							cant do this applies to all projects. We need a big   							list so we can use all the people who want to help   							from a single person to a organisation with lots of   							people. Without this list it will be a cock up.   							People may not be able to come for a day but happy   							to pop in and do an odd hour when it suits them we   							need to make this happen so people can come in know   							what to do and get any tools etc. </p>
            <p><strong>Problems</strong></p>
            <p>Virtually everyone that comes daily has the same   							comment on problems that are not being address. Dogs   							of f the lead, illegal and dangerous fishing , bikes   							and of coarse vandals. As there are no wardens this   							is a major problem for people as no one feels safe   							in the park. Dogs off the lead is a major problem   							and there are a few that come and set the dogs on   							wildlife and are yet to be caught, some are so   							frightened of dogs they have to leave the park if   							they see them off the lead. </p>
            <p>Fishing is a major concern as its very dangerous   							kids ride bike with rods sticking out in front with   							line and hooks attached, they cast next to ducks and   							swans and two swans have suffer already if it   							happens to a duck I don&rsquo;t think the RSPCA would come   							to the rescue and it would die a horribly death. 90%   							of those fishing will have no rod licence and it is   							illegal fines can be as much as £2,500. They leave   							litter and hooks block foot paths cast near people   							and make a mess everywhere after climbing fences and   							causing criminal damage. On Health and Safety   							grounds we can allow fishing even if controlled no   							one is going to be a bailiff and be there all day   							everyday so its not enforceable. As we often have   							Grebe on the lake which is a protect species along   							with the swans fishing is dangerous for them as they   							swim a long way underwater and even a good fisherman   							wouldn&rsquo;t know it was there until it get hooked up.   							99% of regulars are against fishing and the damage   							they cause. </p>
            <p><strong>Dogs off the lead</strong></p>
            <p>Everyday you can find dogs off the lead in the   							park many will let GSD roam around the children's   							play area off the lead, they will be off the lead   							near wildlife and often chase the wildlife and under   							new laws this can be considered a dangerous dog. If   							you come to the park with a young child you dont   							want any dog big or small running about near them   							even f they dont bite they can knock a child over   							and hurt it. If like me you own a dog which you keep   							on the lead you dont want loose dogs attacking your   							dog or coming up to it barking etc. This again is an   							accident waiting to happen. A dog control order is   							being proposed for the park but again with no one   							enforcing it wont do any good. </p>
            <p>Bikes are another problem and one that causes   							confusion as its not clear if and were they can be   							ridden this needs to be made clear. Again sensible   							cyclists are not a problem but kids on BMX speeding   							down path and over the bridge are. </p>
            <p><strong>Wildlife</strong></p>
            <p>Most visitors to the park come in contact with   							the wildlife either to view them or bring the kids   							to feed them. Enough isn&rsquo;t being done to help   							wildlife last year we managed to get a pallet by the   							island and the grebe bred ok this year there was   							none as a results their nest and eggs were destroyed   							by kids and they had no young. Suitable plants for   							nesting are needed by the island away from the kids   							and rams up to the islands so wildlife can get off   							and on with their young this is low cost to do and   							would benefit everyone. A lot of wildlife is   							subjected to people throwing at them or being chased   							by dogs off the lead. </p>
            <p><strong>Vandals </strong></p>
            <p>Vandalism everyone is against that of coarse and   							it needs to be stopped. New CCTV soon to be   							installed will go some way to addressing this but as   							the park may not be on the monitoring screens all   							the time so it may well be missed unless people can   							ring and tell the control room to turn the camera   							screen on. CCTV is no good unless someone can   							respond quickly to problems. </p>
            <p><strong>New Approach </strong></p>
            <p>New approach to the problems. A there are no   							wardens no one is stopping any of this and a warden   							approach can not always work. A new way to tackle   							this education its possible a few ladies with high   							vis jackets could be more effective this is not a   							sexist remark but a practical one often its young   							kids causing problems and a man approaching them in   							this day and age can give concern about paedophiles.   							Women can often deal with the children better being   							mother them selves and often if women with a baby   							approaches a dog owner and explains she is   							frightened for her child as the dog is loose will be   							more effective. In stead of a warden approach its an   							educational approach the same applies to people   							dropping litter which then reduces the time needed   							cleaning up. </p>
            <p>At the present time these problems are not being   							addressed and to get the park back to its formal   							glory need a total approach to the whole problem not   							just some of the problems. As people see   							improvements and more people use the park so the   							problems ill reduce as lots of people in the park   							helps to reduce vandals as they don&rsquo;t like lots of   							people about. Its really not new it goes back to the   							old days when the communities would police its self   							as there was always some stern granny who would tell   							kids off and would be supported by other people. </p>

                  <p> The ANTS volunteer day started today and   										around 40 people of all ages turned up   										to paint bench's, pick up litter, clean   										paths etc. It was good to see children   										getting involved and even brushing up.   										We have one of those brushes at home but   										there is no instruction with it so we   										cant use it. Dont forget this Sunday 1st   										September lots more work to do so get   										down early and and make a day of it ALL   										are Welcome to join in</p>

                <div id="post-body-2854323059543924580" itemprop="description articleBody"> Another incident at the Queens Park as   										the community fights back. Cllr Maureen   										Grant was on site as she often is and   										her and her friend stepped in as wardens   										with me when 6-8 children started   										throwing bikes into the lake. After   										these children were causing problems and   										being yobish they started throwing bike   										in the lake. I was there as backup with   										my dog but to be fair Maureen and her   										friend handled the children and got a   										torrent of foul and obscene language   										from them. Never the less they persisted   										and stopped them running off and made   										them get the bike out of the lake.
                  <p> More abuse followed but they then   										dispersed. It good to see a councillor   										who not only comes to our meeting and   										fights our corner at council but comes   										to the park on a regular basis and gets   										her hand dirty helping the communities   										fight  back against vandalism and yobish   										behaviour this is the second time in a   										week she has taken action to stop   										problems in the park so well done to MO.</p>
                  <p><br />
                    The people who were fishing yesterday   										and hooked the baby swan were back doing   										it again today but what could I say as   										the Police took no action yesterday they   										would take no notice so the Police have   										set us back with this problem. How they   										can walk past Burma Island with kids   										fishing haven broke over the fence   										committing criminal damage I don&rsquo;t   										understand. Cllr Jones has responded to   										my email and is trying to sort something   										out so as a partnership we can solve   										this problem. The simple solution is to   										some how grant the PCSO powers to remove   										anyone fishing or have to remove them if   										a volunteer warden asks for assistance,   										they say they must respond and remove   										people if a council officer requests it.   										While ANTS are doing a great job   										cleaning the place up none so far have   										volunteered to help with warden duties   										and I fear any work they do will be then   										spoilt by vandals. I am an OAP so   										limited what I can do but with more help   										we can take back our park and make it   										safe for wildlife and children. </p>

                  <h5> </h5>
                  <p>Today 4 witnesses watched as a father   										and two sons were fishing near Tipkinder.   										They were not taking any care were they   										cast and the swans and their babies swam   										close to them. They then started   										throwing at the swans at which point we   										called the Police. </p>
                  <p>The RSPCA were called as by then they   										had hooked a baby swan and wrapped line   										and float all around its neck. The RSPCA   										arrived and did a good job of catching   										the baby and fighting off the father   										swan as he kept attacking. The hook was   										removed from the swans neck safely. <br />
                    The RSPCA advised the fisher men of what   										they had done. The Police PCSO arrived   										and walked around seeing 10 other   										fishing under No Fishing signs and took   										no action. They spoke to the ones who   										had hooked the swan and took no action   										and left them fishing to do it again. </p>
                  <p>The PCSO said they don&rsquo;t have the   										powers to shift anyone illegal fishing   										or take any action for dogs off the   										lead. Even when they break into fenced   										off areas to fish causing criminal   										damage they wont take any action. They   										will only take action if fish are   										removed from the park as then they will   										charge them with theft. In the past   										other PSCO have attended and taken   										action on the fishing. </p>
                  <p>Below the RSPCA remove line and hook   										from the swan if you view this full   										screen you can see the line wrapped   										around its neck </p>
                  <p> <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-FP9SK6xTwOU/Uh6Bc1x7fNI/AAAAAAAAKKU/SPqbjyc1GsA/s1600-h/DSCF7277%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7277" alt="DSCF7277" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-tdQavxtmM_c/Uh6BdbOyiFI/AAAAAAAAKKY/AKOC5uFUPdE/DSCF7277_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="338" width="450" /></a></p>
                  <p>They claim that any volunteer wardens   										can not stop anyone fishing or do   										anything about dogs off the lead. They   										say its down to the council or   										environment agency this puts the ball   										directly back in Cllr Jones court as   										people are volunteering but they are   										wasting their time as the council refuse   										to back the project. People volunteer   										and act as wardens to keep the park safe   										for families  risking abuse and the   										council wont help in anyway. Cllr Jones   										spoke on tv of a partnership but it&rsquo;s a   										one sided one if the council wont do   										their bit </p>
                  <p>This is the second time in a couple   										of months a swan has been hooked up and   										one women has been hooked as well. A   										risk assessment would say the odds are   										that a person be it a baby an OAP or   										other is going to suffer horrendous   										injure   while the council refuse to   										take action on this fishing which is   										conducted next to busy public pathways   										by people who don&rsquo;t care were they cast   										the line. The council have a duty of   										care to keep the park safe for people to   										enjoy by failing on Health and Safety   										grounds they leave themselves open to   										being sued if any one is injured given   										the fact they have been told the risk   										and taken no action on dogs or fishing.   										Evidence on Facebook and the website   										could be used by anyone suing the   										council if they get injured. </p>
                  <p> <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-41nvrxcuj_w/Uh6Bd2NYs-I/AAAAAAAAKKk/vqMILZc14lE/s1600-h/DSCF7280%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7280" alt="DSCF7280" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-IcpQJQwbNe8/Uh6BeUxjIUI/AAAAAAAAKKs/YqfTDvvTjm8/DSCF7280_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="342" width="455" /></a><br />
                    Most people who visit the park do so to   										feed the ducks or show them to the   										children and they are horrified that   										they can be killed by people illegally   										fishing. One of the baby swans is   										missing and its possible its died a   										horrible death by fishing line, by a dog   										off the lead  or by a fox. </p>

                <h6> 40-50 people turned   				up to find out exactly what ANTS are all about. Very simple. If   				you care about your beautiful park, lend a minute amount of your   				time to help beautify and maintain it. On 31st August and 1st   				September there will be a chance for Crewe residents to show   				potential sponsors that there is a collective will to do   				something positive. There will be identified tasks to be carried   				out - the repairing of benches, the tidying of paths and the   				weeding of borders - and, almost imperceptibly at first, there   				will be a blossoming of community spirit. There will be families   				enjoying themselves and there will be stuff getting done in an   				atmosphere of happiness and quiet determination. It is just the   				start and we all have a chance to say 'I was there'.</h6>

                <p>One area for volunteers is a park wardens one of the big   				problems is illegal fishing at the moment they tend to break the   				fence on Burma Island and fish under the bridge. As people come   				onto the bridge to feed wildlife the kids still cast in the   				middle of them and its only a matter of time until they are hurt   				not only that they dont watch were they cast and it is only a   				matter of time before someone is hooked up.The other alleged   				problem is we have heard from some kids that being under the   				bridge its great fun to try and look up skirts. Even if people   				could only give an odd hour to be wardens and stop fishing and   				dogs off the lead. Often women will be better at this as most of   				the problems is with young children and mothers know how to deal   				with kids.</p>
                <p>One of the baby swans has now been missing for over a week so   				we fear we have lost it. It could be a fox or a dog off the lead   				or it could have been caught by fishing line. </p>

                A. There will   								be tools there for you but you may also bring   								your own. Obviously some tools may be subject to   								necessary restrictions. <br />
                Q. Are   								children welcome<br />
                A. Yes very   								much so. But there may be places  they cannot go   								on the grounds of health and safety. (And common   								sense. )</h6>
              <p>We are looking for lots of people to come   								forward to help with this and other projects One   								thing we do need is volunteer Wardens to patrol   								the park ideally in two or threes and get dogs   								put on leads stop fishing and other bad   								behaviour but not to put them selves in any   								danger. I am currently the only one doing this.   								Looking ahead to doing bigger projects like   								Burma Island Coronation Walk Lodges gardens so   								there is big scope for anyone interested in   								gardening. Bench's need repairing so any   								carpenters out there with a few hours to spare</p>

                  <p>Over the weekend the Queens Park was   										a battle ground between the CEC and   										protesters complaining about the state   										of the park. The protest came from a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/113405702150/"> facebook group</a> and was a bit rushed   										as the BBC came down but, the CEC turned   										up and some of his reported comments   										were</p>
                  There are no muggings in Crewe and he   										can prove it.<br />
                  He wants a group of volunteers to police   										and maintain the park.<br />
                  He regards us all as having &quot;A Crewe   										mentality&quot;<br />
                  He says we are all &quot;Apathetic&quot;<br />
                  He wants to create jobs in Cheshire   										rather than throw money away, but would   										not create a &quot;Park Warden&quot; or &quot;Park   										Keeper&quot; job.<br />
                  He wants a permanent police presence in   										the park, so shifting the responsibility   										of funding back onto the Police.<br />
                  CEC did not put money in to Macclesfield   										Football Club.<br />
                  CEC is one of the richest councils in   										the country. But why should they put any   										more money into the park given the fact   										that no one in Crewe actually cares   										about the park.
                  <h6> The cost of the wardens is not as great   										as the cost of the damage done in the   										park the quoted cost of damage in the   										park is £1000 per week. The main   										complaints are that even after over 7   										million being spent the park is far from   										finished  and many of the paths are   										dangerous. The actions on Sunday were   										not part of the Friends of Queens Park   										who are the elected committee of the   										park. The friends meeting was held   										tonight and more volunteers turned up to   										get things done in the park. They will   										be picking up litter, repairing benchs,   										weeding, patrolling the the park and   										raising money.</h6>

                  <p>On the plus side the Cafe now has   										CCTV installed monitored 24/7 as the   										cafe has suffered a lot of damage and   										break ins. More CCTV is to be install in   										the near future and the Police have   										provided Mosquitos for the project there   										is all so radio on site to instantly   										call the Police if there is any trouble.

                  <p>Willaston and Rope Ward UKIP   										Councillor Brian Silvester is calling   										for more warden patrols at Queens Park,   										Crewe to curtail the surge in mindless   										vandalism. He said,&quot;<strong> </strong>I understand   										that since the park wardens were removed   										by the Council that  vandalism in the   										park has escalated. The cost of   										vandalism in the last few weeks has   										averaged a £1000 per week. I am calling   										on the Council to take action to stop   										this gross and unnecessary loss of   										public money. Millions have been   										invested in the park to return it to its   										former Victorian glory. It is a great   										shame that the Council short-sightedly   										withdrew the wardens and left the park   										to the mercy of mindless yobs.&quot; </p>

                    <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Queens Park </p>
                  <p>Dear Brian<br />
                    There have been a number of incidents of   										vandalism and theft from QP recently and   										we have held a coordination meeting with   										local police. The incidents tend to   										happen in the late evenings when the   										park is empty. <br />
                    We based the community wardens here some   										months ago to provide a uniformed   										presence as they come and go and police   										have increased their presence through   										pcso's. <br />
                    However, the behaviour continues, so I   										have recently tasked our cctv engineers   										to put together a scheme for the park,   										particularly in those areas which seem   										to be the targets around the pavilion. <br />
                    They are developing this scheme now,   										including looking at lighting, to see   										what can be done to deter this behaviour   										or gather evidence. We do not have a   										specific capital fund for this and we   										will need to look at virement options   										when we have the estimated costs   										available. <br />
                    Hopefully we can make the case for   										invest to save on this given the costs   										of damage so far. It is unfortunate that   										additional security measures were not   										introduced as part of the major project   										works inherited from C&amp;NBC in order to   										protect the investment into the park. We   										will seek to get new funding once we   										have designed an effective scheme based   										on recent incidents. <br />
                    Kind regards<br />
                    Peter </p>

                    <h6> If you enlarge this photo full   											screen you can see the fishing line   											in its mouth We tried to report it   											today but the wardens refused to   											answer the door even though we knew   											they were in. The people fishing   											were still there and its likely it   											was them that did it. This is highly   											dangerous as they are fishing next   											to public paths near Tipkinder last   											year a women got a hook in her coat   											as they dont care were they cast. If   											there is not swift and meaningful   											action by the Police and Council to   											stop this illegal fishing I am   											afraid it will end up with a child   											with a fish hook in its eye or   											similar. They can then sue the   											council for failing its duty of   											care. Its an accident waiting to   											happen we must have a clamp down on   											this fishing or in summer we will be   											flooded with people fishing. It was   											reported on Sunday a loose dog   											attacking wildlife and the owner was   											shouted at but just issued abuse.</h6>

                    <p>The heron was back on site the   											first time this year and it was   											funny as all the geese stopped and   											looked at him as if he was their   											god. I did hear him say ok lads you   											get the bread I will bring the fish.</p>
                    <h3>Dangerous  Dog yet again</h3>
                    <p>An eye witness account of the dog </p>
                    <p>A few weeks ago I saw the Idiot   											and his dog in Queens Park, the dog   											was off the lead, jumping in and out   											of the lake, barking, trying to get   											at the Canadian Geese. The Idiot   											carried on walking around the lake   											as if nothing was untoward. This   											went on for about 25 minutes, and   											all the time the dog was chasing the   											Geese.  </p>
                    <p>On Tuesday 11th June 2013 at   											around 12.15, I entered the Park   											from the South entrance as I do   											every day. Walking around the lake   											clockwise, I noticed the same Idiot   											and his tan and white boxer dog on   											the west side of the lake. I   											witnessed the dog barking and trying   											to get at the two swans and three   											signets that were also at the west   											end of the lake. </p>
                    <p>They continued around the lake   											and I observed the dog squatting   											several times in different areas. No   											attempt to clean up was made, as the   											Idiot was several hundred feet away.   											I stopped and sat down to feed the   											Ducks as I always do near where the   											woodland walk used to be. By this   											time the Idiot and the dog had   											reached the other half of the lake,   											and the dog was again barking at,   											and chasing Geese. The Idiot was   											completely ignoring the mayhem his   											dog was causing, and I saw several   											people crossing the main lake bridge   											stop to look towards the dog, to see   											what all the noise and fuss was   											about. </p>
                    <p>It then occurred to me that I had   											my phone with me (I don't usually).   											I rang the local Police and reported   											what was happening. It was 12.38. At   											around 13.00, the Idiot left the   											Park at the South entrance, and   											headed east. As the Police had not   											arrived by 13.20 or so, I also left   											the park. </p>
                    <p>About an hour later I received a   											call from the Police stating that   											they (obviously) had missed the   											Idiot, but that several people in   											the park had witnessed the dog's   											behaviour. I make no apologies for   											describing the owner of the dog as   											an Idiot. He is medium height and   											build, 35-45 years old, and it is   											quite obvious from my observations   											that the entire world revolves   											around him. He is an Idiot. </p>

                  <p> Lots of complaints this week and people   										are saying the park is now like the Wild   										West as things get out of control and   										the council do nothing about it. Its   										illegal to fish in the lake and there   										are signs everywhere but people sit   										under the signs and fish. Some describe   										it as being like a fishing match as you   										can see above its not just the fact they   										are fishing but they block the path so   										people cant walk around and more   										importantly they cast the line with out   										a thought for anyone walking by. We have   										had people nearly hooked up by people   										casting the line as they walk past.   										Fishing near Tipkinder is the area were   										all the wildlife swim and they are in   										danger from fishing lines as well. </p>
                  <p>Dogs have been high on the agenda as   										complaints pour in ne man counted 15 off   										the lead in one short afternoon with one   										chasing all the wildlife and when the    										owner was approached he only responded   										with verbal abuse. Under new laws the   										chasing of wildlife makes it a dangerous   										dog and it can be shot. Even old people   										come with dogs off the lead and they get   										as abusive as others often when the park   										is packed with young children. Loose   										dogs and children dont mix they may be   										friendly but they  can chase in fun of   										knock children over. Nothing will be   										done until a child is hurt then we will   										see some action. We often have school   										children come to use the park as young   										as 7 and now they have insisted that   										wardens patrol as loose dogs were around   										last time they visited and they cant   										take the chance of a child being hurt.</p>
                  <p>It was discussed at the friends   										meeting about obtaining a dog control   										order the suggestion being that no dogs   										would be allowed around the childs play   										area as you often see loose German   										Shepherds in that area and this is   										clearly unsafe. other suggestion are for   										zoning dogs  were they must be on leads   										etc and a fine would be introduced for   										those failing to comply. </p>
                  <p>Vandalism in the park has now cost   										more than £25,000 a lot of which could   										be saved if we had wardens the council   										are failing in their duty of care and   										not compiling with Health and Safety to   										make the area safe. It appears    										that parks in other Cheshire  towns  are   										looked after a lot better than our park   										and all the money seems to be going to   										there. </p>

            <p>Over the weekend the dangerous dogs were loose in   							the park yet again. A frightening incident occurred   							by the cafe the scouts were in park walking round   							the area. As young scouts approached the cafe over   							the little  bridge two dogs frightened them as they   							ran at them barking and showing their teeth it was   							chasing a rabbit and the scout was mortified as the   							dog drew  blood from the rabbit. The owners were   							asked to put their dogs on a lead and became abusive   							which is a typical reaction they were threatened   							with the Police but just laughed. Given there were   							so many children in the park they show no   							consideration for anyone else and we suspect they   							had brought their dogs to hunt rabbits. It now seems   							clear that any activity that involves children in   							the park must as part of the risk assessment take   							into account the dog menace as the last time   							children were in the park from the school a loose   							dog was about. The next meeting includes dog control   							order</p>

            <p> The first baby of the year was seen this week in   							this case a baby Canadian goose there have been no   							baby ducks so far this year they are behind as lots   							of other places have had them a few weeks. The Gulls   							are hovering around trying to steal eggs again. The   							swans are nesting on the island like they did last   							year but this time they have gone straight to the   							island as last year they laid several eggs in places   							and they were smashed by kids. Lets hop in 3 weeks   							we see some baby swans it will be the first time in   							many a year</p>

            <p>Monday @ 2 oclock I was standing by the Gulf War   							memorial in the park talking to a lady with a   							Yorkshire terrier and another man watch by the   							gardeners. A larges German Sheppard came towards of   							the lead both are dogs were on leads. I explained to   							the owner dogs must be on the lead in the park. The   							next minute his dog savagely attacked the lady ran   							for her life fearing for her dogs safety.   							Fortunately my puppy is an Alaskan Malumute and was   							able to defend his self while the man made vain   							attempts to stop his dog. He eventual got hold of   							his dog but became abusive and still refused to put   							it on a lead despite being shouted at by the   							gardeners and walked off shouting abuse with it   							still off the lead there were 9 witness to the   							attack. </p>
            <p>We went straight to the dog wardens office and   							explained what had happened and told them he was   							still in the park so they could catch him. In front   							of 4 witness they state. </p>
            <p>Its not an offence for a dog to attacks a dog and   							wouldn&rsquo;t do anything or call the Police. </p>
            <p>The don&rsquo;t patrol the park </p>
            <p>The cant enforce not having a dog on the lead in   							the park even though its stated as a bylaw. </p>
            <p>Its not the councils job to deal with this sort   							of problem. </p>
            <p>We pointed to another dog running loose and they   							did nothing for 15 mins then drove round the dog was   							a 3 min walk away. </p>
            <p>We want the dog wardens to undergo further   							training so they can do their job properly a quick   							look at the official Government site <a href="https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/overview"> https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/overview</a></p>
            <p>Shows it is a crime to have a dangerous dog   							loose, the council can enforce it and it is their   							responsibility. The site <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/controlling-your-dog-in-public"> http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/controlling-your-dog-in-public</a></p>
            <p>States Dogs which behave dangerously may be   							seized by the <strong>dog warden</strong>, and their owners   							prosecuted. The dogs may be destroyed if the   							magistrate considers that they are a danger to the   							public. </p>
            <p>This man is a regular in the park and never has   							his dog on the lead he normally goes by the   							bandstand between 12:30 and 2 oclock as do many   							others off the lead. The posh man and women visit at   							these times of the day with a black Labrador off the   							lead and they claim the law doesn&rsquo;t apply to them.   							As the children are off school still and the park is   							now used for young children for education purposes   							its vital the dog wardens get out of their offices   							and catch these people. If a child had been near   							when it attacked it could have easily been killed by   							such a big dog. Its noted by many users that a   							certain councillor visit the park every day and sets   							a bad example with her dog off the lead. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><strong>Overview From Government website</strong></p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s against the law to let a dog be dangerously   							out of control: </p>
            <p>in a public place </p>
            <p>in a private place where the dog isn&rsquo;t allowed to   							be (eg a neighbour&rsquo;s house or garden without   							permission) </p>
            <p>The law applies to <strong>all</strong> dogs. </p>
            <p>Some <a href="https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/banned-dogs"> types of dogs are banned</a>. </p>
            <p><strong>Out of control</strong></p>
            <p>Your dog is considered dangerously out of control   							if it: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>injures someone </li>
              <li>makes someone worried that it might injure   								them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A court could also decide that your dog is   							dangerously out of control if: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>it injures someone&rsquo;s animal </li>
              <li>the owner of the animal thinks they could be   								injured if they tried to stop your dog attacking   								their animal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A farmer is allowed to kill your dog if it&rsquo;s   							worrying their livestock. </p>
            <p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
            <p>You can be fined up to £5,000 and/or sent to   							prison for up to 6 months if your dog is out of   							control. You may also not be allowed to own a dog in   							the future. </p>
            <p>If you let your dog injure someone, you can be   							sent to prison for up to 2 years and/or fined. </p>
            <p>If you deliberately use your dog to injure   							someone you could be charged with &lsquo;malicious   							wounding&rsquo;. The maximum penalty is 5 years in prison. </p>
            <p><strong>Dog Control Orders</strong></p>
            <p>Local councils in England and Wales can issue Dog   							Control Orders (DCOs). </p>
            <p>These mean that in public areas with DCOs, you   							may have to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>keep your dog on a lead </li>
              <li>put your dog on a lead if told to by a   								police officer, police community support officer   								or someone from the council </li>
              <li>stop your dog going in certain places - like   								farmland or parts of a park </li>
              <li>limit the number of dogs you have with you   								(this applies to professional dog walkers too) </li>
              <li>clear up after your dog</li>
            </ul>
            <p>DCOs <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> apply to private land if you   							have permission from the land owner or person who   							controls the land. </p>
            <p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
            <p>If you ignore a DCO, you can be fined: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>£50 on the spot (a &lsquo;Fixed Penalty Notice&rsquo;) </li>
              <li>up to £1,000 if it goes to court</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> be fined if you&rsquo;re a registered   							blind dog owner. </p>
            <p><strong>DCOs in your area</strong></p>
            <p>Local councils must let the public know where   							DCOs are in place. </p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong> If dogs aren&rsquo;t allowed in a park,   							there must be signs saying so. </p>
            <p>If the council plans to put a new DCO in place,   							it must put up a notice and publish it in a local   							newspaper and on its website. </p>
            <p>The notice must tell you: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>where the new DCO will apply </li>
              <li>if there&rsquo;s a map and where you can see it </li>
              <li>where you can write or email to have your   								say - you should have at least 28 days </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After 28 days, your local council will decide   							whether to go ahead with the DCO or change it. If   							there are lots of changes, the council will publish   							another notice, with the same timescales. </p>
            <h3>Report a dog</h3>
            <p>Anyone can report a dog and their owner to the   							police. </p>
            <p>You can report a dangerous dog to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council"> your council&rsquo;s</a> dog warden service. </p>

            <p>We now have float islands for the wildlife so   							they can breed away from the side of the lake were   							last year Yobs stole and smashed their eggs. Above a   							Moorhen try's one out for size normally there is   							rubbish in the lake so the wildlife can build a nest   							but they have the base for a nest but no rubbish etc   							to build one at the moment. Some straw was put on   							the island that can be used but Grebe cant walk so   							there is no way for them to get at it.</p>

            <p> These handsome diving ducks are a member of the   							sawbill family, so called because of their long,   							serrated bills, used for catching fish. A largely   							freshwater bird, the goosander first bred in the UK   							in 1871. It built up numbers in Scotland and then   							since 1970 it has spread across northern England   							into Wales, reaching south-west England. Its love of   							salmon and trout has brought it into conflict with   							fishermen. It is gregarious, forming into flocks of   							several thousand in some parts of Europe. </p>

            <p>The starlings are taking their toll on the park   							as you can see the tree is white with their   							droppings and they are ruining lots of plants not to   							mention the smell but there is little we can do   							about it with so many nesting</p>

            <p> Start of another year in the park Happy New year to   							all our readers</p>
            <p>I had complaints about this women letting her dog   							loose in the park frightening people and chasing   							ducks. Stopped her and explained there is a bylaw   							that dogs must be on the lead and signs all over the   							park. her reply was it doesnt apply to her and go   							and catch some yobs instead. She seems to think   							being posh means she is above the law and she doesnt   							appear to care that she upsets commoners. It doesnt   							matter how nice the dog is some people dont like   							dogs and if you have small children you dont want   							them running near your children even if its friendly   							it can knock children over. even after being told   							she continues to let it off the lead. She is actual   							the second person who has said the law doesnt apply   							to them. If you see her tell her to get it on the   							lead if enough people tell her she may take notice.   							People only have to go a few feet to Tipkinder or   							the playing fields if they want to let dogs loose </p>

            <p>These stupid children walking on the outside of   							the big Broadwalk bridge this week and then doing   							the old Harry Worth (who remembers him) trick of   							standing on one foot and holding on with one hand.   							The problem is you cant shout in case you make them   							jump and they fall. But they are an accident waiting   							to happen</p>
