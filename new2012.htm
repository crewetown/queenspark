          <p> We have had a spate of bins being   											thrown in the lake every bin near   											the lake is now in the lake.

          <p>Contractors have been putting in   											data cables to the cafe and a right   											cock up they have made of it as you   											can  see they took the trench right   											next to the trees cutting the roots   											so that will do them good. They then   											worked out they had to go further   											down the back to get to the cafe so   											then went at right angles as they   											will have to pull a cable through   											the pipe it will be hard work.</p>

          <p>The first time this year the lake   											has been frozen I didnt think it had   											been that cold but it was frozen   											over today. This brings the problems   											of kids messing about on the ice   											like we had last year. There was   											some young kids stamping on the ice   											today and its very dangerous if you   											see anything stupid like this if   											need be phone the Police before they   											get killed. </p>
          <p>The swans are still missing and   											have been gone for a few weeks now   											lets hope they come back soon. </p>
          <p>Following on from last year&rsquo;s   											work on developing Crewe Park as an   											educational resource MMU PGCE   											primary students will be able to   											undertake a special short project in   											the New Year.  This will involve   											students meeting in the park for an   											introductory visit and talk,by other   											park staff/friends (Elaine and   											Linda)to lead this, on <strong>Monday 28th   											January pm (1-3 approx).</strong>  This   											would then be followed up by   											students working with a class of   											children from one of the local   											schools on <strong>Wednesday 30th   											January</strong>, morning or afternoon  -   											(perhaps half a group in each   											session).  The students will have   											devised science based activities to   											work on with the children in the   											park – appropriate to the age range   											of the children.  This would then   											have the possibility of being   											followed up in the school on Monday   											afternoon 4th February.    											We are hoping that students will   											produce a scheme of work of which   											they will have delivered a small   											part, and make contributions to the   											Crewe Park website, if you think   											this is appropriate.  </p>

          <p>Herons have been back this week a   											bit different as two have been here   											and not staying on the normal island   											but getting closer to people and   											landing on the grass which they   											never normally do. It  look like one   											may be a young one finding his way   											around. The one above was on Burma   											Island and its rare to get close for   											a photo.</p>

          <p>An on going problem is kids   											playing football on the bowling   											green with studs  on and ruining the   											green today (Sunday) it wasn't just   											kids adults were there with their   											kids playing football. The gardeners   											are having a hard time repairing it   											daily. Again Sunday and kids were   											there fishing, dogs off the lead   											chasing wildlife and other dogs not   											on the lead. Is it so hard to keep a   											dog on the lead? if you want to let   											it off then there are two fields   											with 1 min of the park you can do   											that many people are terrified when   											they see dogs off the lead and with   											young children and wildlife its very   											dangerous. When a child get mauled   											then something will be done.  </p>

          <p>A lot of baby rabbits about this   											week a bit timid but there are lots   											to be seen if you walk around   											quietly. The swans and Grebe are   											still  sitting on the nests and its   											hoped we will see some new life from   											them soon. What could be more   											important is the Barnacle Goose has   											been sitting on a nest for a while.   											It a very rare bird in this part of   											the world but they have never bread   											in the uk there were some at Tatton   											Park in 1972 but they never had   											young so if ours has young even   											crossed with others it will be a   											national event.</p>

          <p>The two holes in the path covered   											in metal plates above have been   											filled in this week as kids were   											pushing the plates off leaving deep   											holes</p>

          <p>The kids have removed the edging   											stones from the gates making it   											simple for them to break in at night   											and cause more damage.</p>
          <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-QqaOq4qRoM8/T_DZWNC-y2I/AAAAAAAAFt4/jB2r9aBo6UI/s1600-h/DSCF7256%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7256" alt="DSCF7256" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-oYefhfDVVjE/T_DZXXG7pFI/AAAAAAAAFt8/JiXl7gS-YbY/DSCF7256_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="178" width="238" /></a></p>
          <p>The gardens had a metal boat to    											get to the islands to weed this week   											and they pulled it ashore while they   											had dinner. Next minute these two   											cheeky chappies  were in it and away   											with it as they pulled it from the   											lake we had visions of them stealing   											it and walking down Alton st with it   											to cash it in. You could imagine the   											Police report be on the look out for   											two lads in a boat down Alton St.   											The Police came with a few mins and   											caught them. So remember any   											problems in the park call 101 and   											ask for Police at Crewe they are   											responding quickly and the more   											reports we have the better the   											evidence to get Wardens back</p>

          <p>Despite other wildlife loosing   											chicks the baby Moorhen has survived   											on the island away from yobs and it   											is helped by fierce parent that   											tackle anything coming near it not   											matter how big.</p>
          <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-QrVzIrQEMJY/T6cGpNAP-oI/AAAAAAAAFVw/XwH7tAQ053s/s1600-h/DSCF4922%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF4922" alt="DSCF4922" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-R4nrjv6e1Uc/T6cGqB-hccI/AAAAAAAAFV0/YL6xvxXSdkQ/DSCF4922_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="292" width="205" /></a></p>
          <p>If you can see it on the picture   											above the treecreeper is small, very   											active, bird that lives in trees. It   											has a long, slender, downcurved   											bill. It is speckly brown above and   											mainly white below. It breeds in the   											UK and is resident here. Birds leave   											their breeding territories in autumn   											but most range no further than 20   											km. Its population is mainly stable. </p>
          <h5>Where to see them</h5>
          <p>Best looked for on the trunks of   											trees in suitable woodland. In   											autumn and winter, it often joins   											flocks of tits and other small   											birds, so if you come across such a   											flock in a wood, it is worth   											listening out for a treecreeper   											among them. They are very small and   											hard to see and even harder to take   											pictures of </p>
          <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8XXthnldczo/T6cGtMdTRnI/AAAAAAAAFWA/FKaExShXVdA/s1600-h/DSCF4930%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF4930" alt="DSCF4930" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-dkjeYTRXfZU/T6cGuHQoEQI/AAAAAAAAFWI/lBy8rSjxYRM/DSCF4930_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="290" width="203" /></a></p>

          <p>The first baby Canadian geese can   											be seen here there are four so far   											lets hope they have more luck than   											the swans and Grebe .</p>
          <p>We are still trying to get hay   											bails around the island so the Grebe   											and swans can nest in peace. The   											wildlife experts came last week and   											reported.</p>
          <p>Countryside service ......In the   											short term you could consider   											putting in a couple of floating nest   											platforms, though these would need   											to be situ ideally within the next   											fortnight to stand any chance of   											being used this year. Unfortunately   											from a first trawl on the internet   											we&rsquo;ve been unable to identify   											anything suitable &lsquo;off the peg&rsquo;.   											However you could instead consider   											contacting one of the local   											conservation groups who may be   											willing to make one for you. As a   											start try... (Contact made   											arrangements underway).<br />
            .... Short of making a very secure   											(human free!) area this is   											impossible to guard against,   											especially if the nests are so very   											accessible.... appropriate   											interpretive messages is the most   											cost effective measure, helping to   											engender public interest and help   											for their protection. (Signs   											arranged). It is the public&rsquo;s eyes &amp;   											ears that are your best weapon in   											combating such anti-social   											behaviours of this kind. (Further   											inspections made today by wildfowl   											specialists). </p>
          <p>So at the present time nothing   											has been done and time is running   											out all for a few bails of hay or   											similar </p>

          <p>OVERSEAS MUSCIANS TO VISIT QUEENS   											PARK<br />
            The May Bank Holiday is very nearly   											upon us and that means time for   											Crewe Brass to welcome our friends   											from Crewe's twin town of   											Bischofsheim in Germany!<br />
            HHS Bischofsheim, the town's   											brilliant accordion orchestra will   											be arriving for a programme of   											activity and music.<br />
            One highlight is a free Concert to   											be performed at Crewe's Queens Park   											on Sunday 6 May from 2pm, with Crewe   											Brass and HHS Bischofsheim   											performing both classics and   											favourites, on the stunning newly   											renovated bandstand a beautiful   											backdrop to this talented band of   											musicians. All are welcome. The band   											are hoping for lots of sunshine so   											that everyone can enjoy a picnic in   											the park before the performance. </p>

          <p> People in the Queens Park were   											horrified today as children played   											on the frozen lake. As you can see   											above they were walking right across   											the lake and one was a young child.   											The Police were called and they   											rushed to get them off the lake   											before they fell in. They than took   											their names and were going around to   											the parents to advise them of the   											dangers. This has been happening all   											week with people of all ages doing   											these stupid things like smashing   											the ice they are standing on with   											bricks bikes etc.</p>
          <p>Parent warn your children of the   											dangers of open water not only of   											the park. If any had fell in they   											could be dead very quick if they   											slipped under the ice and low   											temperature could prove fatal. If   											anyone witness this stupid behaviour   											then call the Police before a child   											dies. They have been pulling stones   											off the wall and throwing them onto   											the ice as well. All the money spent   											cleaning the lake and its getting   											full of rubbish.</p>
          <p>This leads on to another story   											this week that the final warden has   											now been given 6 weeks notice so it   											would appear that we will have no   											one protecting our 7m park soon.</p>

          <p>The swans have had us guessing   											this week. We had the new one arrive   											but this week one of the old pair   											went missing for 2 days but it has   											now come back so there are still the   											three on the lake. Maybe he had been   											for a day out.</p>

          <p> A pink footed goose has been at the park this week   							its one we havent seen before.</p>
          <h5>Latin name</h5>
          <p>Anser brachyrhynchus </p>
          <h5>Family</h5>
          <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/swans.aspx"> Swans, ducks and geese</a> (Anatidae) </p>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>The pink-footed goose is a medium-sized goose,   							smaller than a mute swan but bigger than a mallard.   							It is pinkish grey with a dark head and neck, a pink   							bill and pink feet and legs. This species does not   							breed in the UK, but large numbers of birds spend   							the winter here, arriving from their breeding   							grounds in Spitsbergen, Iceland and Greenland.   							Numbers in England are on the increase, particularly   							in Norfolk, probably due to better protection at   							winter roosts. </p>
          <h5>Where to see them</h5>
          <p>Large estuaries, such as on the east Scottish   							coast, The Wash, the Ribble and the Solway, or on   							surrounding farmland where birds go in the day to   							feed. </p>
          <h5>When to see them</h5>
          <p>They arrive in the UK in October and depart in   							April. </p>
          <h5>What they eat</h5>
          <p>Grain, winter cereals, potatoes and grass. </p>

          <p>The on going problem with the Grebes and swans   							trying to nest continues as the grebe try on the   							main bank and they stand no chance there as yobs   							will soon destroy the eggs.

          <p>We have seen a few Black headed Gulls coming this   							week</p>
          <p>Chroicocephalus ridibundus </p>
          <h5>Family</h5>
          <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/gulls.aspx"> Gulls</a> (Laridae) </p>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>Not really a black-headed bird, more   							chocolate-brown - in fact, for much of the year, it   							has a white head. It is most definitely not a   							'seagull' and is found commonly almost anywhere   							inland. Black-headed gulls are sociable,   							quarrelsome, noisy birds, usually seen in small   							groups or flocks, often gathering into larger   							parties where there is plenty of food, or when they   							are roosting. </p>
          <h5>Where to see them</h5>
          <p>The commonest inland gull, particularly in N   							England, Scotland and Wales. Large colonies along   							the south and east coasts of England. </p>
          <h5>When to see them</h5>
          <p>All year round. </p>
          <h5>What they eat</h5>
          <p>Worms, insects, fish and carrion. </p>

          <p><strong>Periwinkle</strong> is a colour in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue">blue</a> family.

          <p> A pink footed goose has been at the park this week   							its one we havent seen before.</p>
          <h5>Latin name</h5>
          <p>Anser brachyrhynchus </p>
          <h5>Family</h5>
          <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/swans.aspx"> Swans, ducks and geese</a> (Anatidae) </p>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>The pink-footed goose is a medium-sized goose,   							smaller than a mute swan but bigger than a mallard.   							It is pinkish grey with a dark head and neck, a pink   							bill and pink feet and legs. This species does not   							breed in the UK, but large numbers of birds spend   							the winter here, arriving from their breeding   							grounds in Spitsbergen, Iceland and Greenland.   							Numbers in England are on the increase, particularly   							in Norfolk, probably due to better protection at   							winter roosts. </p>
          <h5>Where to see them</h5>
          <p>Large estuaries, such as on the east Scottish   							coast, The Wash, the Ribble and the Solway, or on   							surrounding farmland where birds go in the day to   							feed. </p>
          <h5>When to see them</h5>
          <p>They arrive in the UK in October and depart in   							April. </p>
          <h5>What they eat</h5>
          <p>Grain, winter cereals, potatoes and grass. </p>

          <p>We have seen a few Black headed Gulls coming this   							week</p>
          <p>Chroicocephalus ridibundus </p>
          <h5>Family</h5>
          <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/gulls.aspx"> Gulls</a> (Laridae) </p>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>Not really a black-headed bird, more   							chocolate-brown - in fact, for much of the year, it   							has a white head. It is most definitely not a   							'seagull' and is found commonly almost anywhere   							inland. Black-headed gulls are sociable,   							quarrelsome, noisy birds, usually seen in small   							groups or flocks, often gathering into larger   							parties where there is plenty of food, or when they   							are roosting. </p>
          <h5>Where to see them</h5>
          <p>The commonest inland gull, particularly in N   							England, Scotland and Wales. Large colonies along   							the south and east coasts of England. </p>
          <h5>When to see them</h5>
          <p>All year round. </p>
          <h5>What they eat</h5>
          <p>Worms, insects, fish and carrion. </p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>All over the Periwinkle all over the site seen   							here under Broadwalk bridge </p>
          <p><strong>Periwinkle</strong> is a colour in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue">blue</a> family. Its name is derived from the lesser   							periwinkle or myrtle herb (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinca_minor">Vinca   							minor</a></em>) which bears flowers of the same   							colour. </p>
          <p>The colour <em>Periwinkle</em> is also called <strong> lavender blue</strong></p>

          <p> This week on Monday a new swan arrived at the Queens   							Park its unusual for a single swan to come but its   							turned up and stayed all week. The swans seem to get   							on ok we thought there may have been a fight but as   							you can see they swim together ok.</p>

          <p>We have had the normal yobish behaviour again   							this week as they decided to throw the life belt   							into the lake along with tree branches. If someone   							get into trouble no one can help as the life belt   							cant be thrown.</p>

            <p> We have seen new wildlife in the park this week like   							the kestrel up near the bandstand and the playing   							fields.</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Falco tinnunculus </p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/falcons.aspx"> Falcons and allies</a> (Falconidae) </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Kestrels are found in a wide variety of habitats,   							from moor and heath, to farmland and urban areas.   							The only places they do not favour are dense   							forests, vast treeless wetlands and mountains. They   							are a familiar sight, hovering beside a motorway, or   							other main road. They can often be seen perched on a   							high tree branch, or on a telephone post or wire, on   							the look out for prey. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>
            <p>Small mammals and birds </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-uoYgHZa_-nI/UM5YRgS2DeI/AAAAAAAAH6w/Ru8vVvc-Odg/s1600-h/DSCF5974%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF5974" alt="DSCF5974" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-HfLgYyJg3M8/UM5YSjsu43I/AAAAAAAAH68/E33-ukf_JH0/DSCF5974_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="625" width="334" /></a></p>
            <p>The Greylag goose was seen for an odd day he did   							that last year popped in for a short while</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Anser anser </p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p>Swans, ducks and geese (Anatidae) </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Greylag geese are easily seen in lowland areas of   							the UK all year, sometimes even in suburban parks   							with lakes but especially on low-lying grassy fields   							in river valleys. Wild ones, however, are found   							mostly north of the Solway and can be seen at RSPB   							nature reserves such as Mersehead (Dumfries &amp;   							Galloway), Vane Farm (Fife) and Loch of Strathbeg   							(Grampian) from September to April. Wild breeding   							greylags can be found at Forsinard (Caithnes &amp;   							Sutherland). </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round in the south; mostly September to   							March or April where wild visitors appear in the   							north. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>
            <p>Grass, roots, cereal leaves and spilled grain </p>

            <h5>A Buzzard has been around the park this   							week</h5>
            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/hawks.aspx"> Hawks, vultures and eagles</a> (Accipitridae)</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Now the commonest and most widespread UK bird of   							prey. It is quite large with broad, rounded wings,   							and a short neck and tail. When gliding and soaring   							it will often hold its wings in a shallow 'V' and   							the tail is fanned. Birds are variable in colour   							from all dark brown to much paler variations, all   							have dark wingtips and a finely barred tail. Their   							plaintive mewing call could be mistaken for a cat.</p>
            <h3>Where to see them</h3>
            <p>Greatest numbers in Scotland, Wales, the Lake   							District and SW England, but now breeding in every   							county of the UK. Found in most habitats   							particularly woodland, moorland, scrub, pasture,   							arable, marsh bog and villages. May even be seen in   							towns and cities including Glasgow. Look for birds   							soaring over wooded hillsides in fine weather, or   							perched on fence posts and pylons. In some areas   							they are known as the tourists&rsquo; eagle, often being   							mistaken for this larger bird of prey.</p>
            <h3>When to see them</h3>
            <p>All year round. Birds soar, display and call most   							in spring.</p>
            <h3>What they eat</h3>
            <p>Small mammals, birds and carrion. And even   							earthworms and large insects when other prey is in   							short supply.</p>

A traditional   							Victorian Park with 45 acre walkways, band stands,   							trees, crown green bowling, 4 1/2 acre ornamental   							lake, grassed areas, memorials and lakeside   							pavillion. A fantastic Autumn Sunday had by all.</p>

            <p> Some surprise visitor to the parks wild life this   							week first the had the cormorant pear this week its   							not a very good picture as you can see it was   							throwing it down.</p>
            <p>A large and conspicuous waterbird, the cormorant   							has an almost primitive appearance with its long   							neck making it appear almost reptilian. It is often   							seen standing with its wings held out to dry.   							Regarded by some as black, sinister and greedy,   							cormorants are supreme fishers which can bring them   							into conflict with anglers and they have been   							persecuted in the past. The UK holds internationally   							important wintering numbers. It has been seen a few   							days fishing in the lake</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-pNhl-pv_RRY/UHIK9-2rlXI/AAAAAAAAHS8/fQAp_OTaYGs/s1600-h/DSCF5726%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF5726" alt="DSCF5726" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-cunAzAT6g9Y/UHIK-uoE2CI/AAAAAAAAHTE/6em7mECmeoI/DSCF5726_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="451" width="533" /></a></p>
            <p>The <strong>Abacot Ranger duck </strong>  was originally   							produced in the UK, was even described in Feathered   							World's 'Ducks' (1926) - and then disappeared from   							the UK record. Fortunately for this attractive   							breed, the Germans developed the 'silver   							wild-colour' to perfection and maintained the Abacot   							Ranger or <strong>Streicher </strong>as a popular breed on the   							continent until its re-discovery as a distinctive   							breed in the UK in the 1980s.The ducks are   							particularly attractive. They have a 'hood' of   							fawn-buff feathers  (hence the name 'hooded ranger')   							and a creamy white body beautifully streaked and   							marked with colour. Like their relatives - the   							Campbells and Harlequins - they are very good   							layers. These two appeared this week and are very   							tame and will eat out your hand.</p>
            <p>Autumn roles on and the first tree by the lake is   							now dropping leaves like mad and other trees are   							changing colour fast so winter is on its way. Having   							said that Today Sunday has been lovely as the son   							was out and you didnt need a coat or a brolly  </p>

            <p>We have been hit by vandals again this week when   							they ripped all the stones off the wall at the   							bottom of the lake and threw them all in the lake.   							They then smashed others further up and smashed the   							stones as well. </p>

            <p> A crazy time this week when the gardener called me   							over to help as a baby squirrel had gone inside his   							mower as he was cutting the grass. How he didnt get   							cut is a miracle as you can see above he was right   							inside.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-UcxnYcZ_JmY/UE0p4UHa9aI/AAAAAAAAG0g/UtL8E_XJ1mA/s1600-h/DSCF5566%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF5566" alt="DSCF5566" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-AO51sr0qNQ0/UE0p5JMLKhI/AAAAAAAAG0k/OuaGJrEuBNk/DSCF5566_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="404" width="538" /></a></p>
            <p>We got him out and he sat on your hand and didnt   							want to move I had to keep and eye on him while the   							mowing was finished in case he went under again.   							Sadly a few days latter we found his body.</p>

            <p> Once again the Bowling hut has come under attack   							from vandals as they tried to smash the doors down   							this week. The window is broken and the door locks   							were also broken as they tried to force the door   							open. Today there was  tar on the windows.

            <p>It was raining in the park so we sheltered under   							the bowling hut you have to remember this is a   							£650,000 hut not a shed from the market. Look at the   							4 photos put into one the windows have a big gap   							under them the wood is splitting like nothing on   							earth not just little cracks but big uns all over.   							It not been up that long next time you go take a   							close look the joins in the wood ar eigdy pigly a   							kid at school could make better joints. At this rate   							it will fall down in a short time. if it was a shed   							you would take it back for a refund. The reason the   							kids could shack the door is because the bolt hole   							is to sizes to big so it has lots of play in it. The   							good old bowlers left it open last night as they   							couldnt get the door shut Well Done lads</p>

            <p> With the summer holidays the illegal fishing has   							been going on again and the Police have been called   							several times. Lot so of notices are now displayed   							in the park and still they fish under the notice and   							let dogs off the lead. There were lots of complaints   							about one family who went down Tipkinder end fishing   							sitting right on the path and casting were all the   							dusks and swans are. They hooked a babies pram with   							the line not looking what they were doing and also   							another women walking her dogs. When told they got   							very abusive. Another lot of men threatened a   							pensioner with violence when he pointed out the   							signs. Be warned if your caught you can face  a   							£1,000 fine the Police will be called so make sure   							your children are not there fishing. The cafe had   							its tips stolen this week when they stole a box with   							£80 in it.</p>

            <p>The swans are still on the nest and have been   							there far to long unless they have laid more eggs as   							the normal time is 36 days but they have been there   							since June so there is little hope of any young.

            <p>Dear All, </p>
            <p>May I please request that everyone forwards me a   							letter of support for the next Heritage Lottery   							Applications which is currently being complied. </p>
            <p>Please indicate your support for the project   							(this is a new application so no mention to the old   							works should be included as this won&rsquo;t be   							considered), indicating why you consider the works   							important  ie footways, accessibility, lighting   							level, boating platform, electric for eventing,   							historical features, re-introduce Coronation walk,   							Burma star island /memorial etc etc., information   							signage... or simply just to bring QP back to her   							original Victorian glory, securing use for future   							generations..... – in fact anything you consider is   							important to the project/park/town. </p>
            <p>Please write on behalf of your organisation or as   							an individual – or both!!! </p>
            <p>Please address to myself: </p>

            <p> Its been a sad week week this week as many of you   							know Max above has visited the Queens Park every day   							for the last few years. Many people loved him as he   							was so peaceful. We have had him over 8 years he was   							a recue dog with seven homes before us. He suffered   							with a rare eye complaint which meant most of his   							life he was going blind till in the end his vision   							was very small. He loved the park and often lay   							there while ducks pecked bread of him. This week we   							had to say good bye as he was in pain from his neck   							,not eating, sad. He had a good life with 10 mile a   							day walks and he was a good dog you could leave   							chocolate on the low table and he wouldnt touch it.   							He is sadly missed. </p>

            <p>We have now got a Alaskan Malamute puppy Jax   							above he is only 9 weeks old and when full grown   							will be 130 lbs plus and be able to pull several   							tons on a sledge and will look like the dog below.   							Jax has his <a target="_blank" href="http://alaskanmalamutejax.blogspot.co.uk/"> own blog as people</a> want to know how you raise   							these dogs. Once he has had his injection and big   							enough he will be seen around the park like Max</p>

            <p>The grebe at long last has some young just born   							on Saturday you wont see them unless you double   							click on the image and view it full screen they are   							two scrawny little things.</p>

            <p>We thought the gulls had taken the young as they   							dived onto the nest and flew off but I caught them    							on camera and it was the last egg they got as you   							can see below. They are worse than vulture hovering   							around the nests</p>

            <h6>The   							Police are now patrolling the park and they have   							covert operation running to catch the vandals they   							told me today. As normal as soon as they had left   							the park two 35 year olds with their wives and dog   							were in the park and the dog attacked the wildlife   							right into the lake. I pointed the sign out to them   							dogs must be on a lead. I was then met with the   							normal abuse and four letter words mind my own   							business get a life etc. Then one threatened to   							smash my head in that is the action of a sniffling   							coward who thinks he is big threatening a OAP. It   							sad when people are so sick they feel the need to   							pick on oap's they never know who these oap's are   							and may get more than they bargained for</h6>

            <p>The big News is the burning of the Broadwalk   							bridge which cost £250,000. A dusbin was placed on   							the bridge on Friday and set on fire being a plastic   							bin it melted and has burnt through  the bridge. </p>

            <p>It looks as if its been caught in time as if the   							main beam was badly burnt half the bridge would have   							to come to bits to replace it.

I showed him the signs   							that he shouldn't be close to the lake and got a   							load of abuse off him a fine example to young   							people. He did a runner when the Police turned up </p>

            <p>At long last the Grebe have found the bail of hay   							and seem to have nested on there. They have tried   							nesting for months but kids pinch the eggs so for   							once they are safe next to the island. The swan has   							now been on the nest on the island for a few weeks   							so we hope to see some young it normal takes about   							36 days for the eggs to hatch.</p>

            <p>Channel 4  is making a major series with Heston   							Blumenthal which aims to bring back to life the fun   							and nostalgia of our favourite foods. In each   							episode, Heston will research one of our favourite   							eating experiences and put his unusual twist on   							them, making people take time out of their busy   							lives to come together as communities and rekindle   							their fond food memories.  He plans to not only make   							these meal-times innovative and delicious, but to   							make them supersized too – to amaze and feed the   							masses. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In this episode Heston wants to bring back the   							ice cream experience that we had when we were   							younger and this Ice Cream Olympics day is an   							opportunity to find out what the public remember   							about their favourite ice creams. We would like   							members of the Crewe community to come down at 2pm   							on Saturday June 16th  with old   							photographs of them or their family eating ice   							creams to show Heston. </p>
            <p>Please let me know if you are able to come along   							and if you have anything suitable to bring – so I   							can let the producer know!! </p>

            <p>The two white ducks were back this week and on   							Tuesday they had 3 yellow chicks Wednesday they were   							down to two and by Thursday there was only one left.   							Lets hope this one survives what killing them we   							dont know but one disappeared in the day it was   							there at 2 pm by 5pm it had gone. People are still   							reporting Yobs throwing stones at young chicks so it   							you see this call the Police</p>

            <p> A few report this week of people witnessing the   							swans being attacked by yobs. There are very stiff   							penalties if they are caught so if you see anyone   							doing this ring the Police as they are a protected   							bird.</p>
            <p>What do swans eat I am often asked</p>
            <p>So what do swans eat? The following are the   							common foods that most swans eat: </p>
            <p>• Aquatic Plants - since swans spend most of   							their time in bodies of water like ponds and lakes,   							they also source out their food from here. They   							usually feed on stems, roots, leaves, tubers and   							other parts of any aquatic plants. This is not a   							problem for swan raised on natural bodies of water;   							however, people that raise their swans in man-made   							ponds or lakes must ensure that aquatic plants are   							present to serve as the swan's food. </p>
            <p>• Insects - swans also wander on land and they   							can eat whatever small insect that may come into   							their way. This includes snails, aquatic beetles and   							many more. This is the intriguing part about what do   							swans eat; at first people thought that swans are   							purely herbivorous but as time passes by, it was   							discovered that swans also feed on small insects. </p>
            <p>• Small Aquatic Animals - this includes shrimps,   							small fishes and other small aquatic animals. These   							aquatic animals are eaten by fully mature swans   							living in a natural pond or lake. </p>
            <p>• Grains and Vegetables - this is the usual food   							for domesticated swans, especially those that are   							raised on farms. Swans on captivity feed on corns   							and other grains as well as on left over vegetable   							scraps. </p>
            <p><strong>Grain, such as wheat, and vegetable   							matter, especially lettuce and potatoes, can be fed   							to swans.</strong> Food should be thrown into the   							water to avoid encouraging the birds onto the bank. </p>
            <p>This week 7 staff came down to put a hay bail and   							pallets in the lake for the swans and grebes to nest   							on away from the banks were they are being attacked.   							Above the man wades out to fit the hay. </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yePGtudrnOE/T8Ktfv1R1xI/AAAAAAAAFbs/8_PY7354g3I/s1600-h/DSCF6834%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF6834" alt="DSCF6834" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-amBLaAGrARQ/T8KtgZkAy_I/AAAAAAAAFb0/fpAF1LZDYvQ/DSCF6834_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="399" width="531" /></a></p>
            <p>The swans tried it out the next day but now seem   							to have used it to get onto the island so lets hope   							they nest there safely. Hopefully they are returning   							in a few days with more hay for the Grebes </p>

            <p>The two white ducks were back again this week so   							we dont know were one hides but it seems to come and   							go maybe it has a nest close by.</p>

            Its getting harder every week to find something to   							show from the park as no work is being done other   							than maintenance. So its all down to wildlife as   							that's all that's happening.<br />
            This week we have the Heron back on site for a few   							days he was getting chase doff the islands by Coats   							as they are nesting so he has been on the bank a lot   							this week. <br />

            Some time ago we found out about the two white ducks   							from the person that brought them he said.<br />
            Hi, I am a regular visitor to the park and a real   							wildlife enthusiast. I by chance searched for   							wildlife sightings at the park to see If anyone   							logged the comings and goings and was very pleased   							to find your site. The reason I wish to contact you   							is to shed light on the two white ducks and let you   							know the story as I am the guy with the pet carrier   							who released them. I am a former manager of Stapeley   							water gardens and every yr we had numerous families   							of ducks, sadly as I'm sure your aware Stapeley   							closed and last yr a lot of ponds were filled in and   							one duck sat on eggs basically in a building site!   							Sadly many of the youngsters fell prey to the local   							cats and mum abandoned the two remaining youngsters   							on their very first day in the big wide world. I   							rescued the pair and one of my broody hens became   							stepmom. My plan was always to keep them as wild as   							possible and release them in a safe natural   							environment when I believed they would have a decent   							chance against predators! So this is exactly what I   							did and couldn't think of a better place than your   							park where they would have a helping hand with   							people regularly feeding the wildfowl their plus my   							regular visits. I hope this is ok in hindsight maybe   							I should have asked permission!? They are both   							standard mallards whose mum was the standard brown   							but they obviously have something from their father   							or mums ancestors in their genes. On seeing them on   							your website and noticing the insert about them   							bring brought in a cage I just wanted you to know   							the history behind them. <br />
            Now we only have one left we dodnt know if the other   							has left to get married or what has happened but its   							not been around for a couple of weeks. They used to   							be cheeky and visit the gardeners hut at dinner time   							for butties. </div>

            <p> I grabbed this shot on a very very wet Sunday this   							is Coronation Walk Stream working not because its   							been fixed but the rain has been so bad but its nice   							to see how this should look and used to be when it   							worked years ago</p>

            <p>The Grey Wagtail has been about a lot this week   							and must be breading near the lake.</p>

            <p>Bad news on the Swans they went back to their   							nest by the bridge and laid eggs as you can see but   							latter in the week the eggs were found smashed on   							the bowling green. There are stiff penalties for   							anyone stealing eggs or hurting Swans or Grebes both   							are protected birds. The swans are now trying   							another nest but this week the Rangers are coming   							down on Tuesday to see if they can help we have   							asked for hay bails around the islands with a ramp   							so swans and grebe can bread by the island in   							safety. A Grebe laid eggs this week and in a short   							time they were taken. Its a very sad world when   							wildlife is destroyed in this way. </p>

            <p>On Tuesday I spotted the new chick the first this   							year the mother and father showed off the 11 chicks   							and both parents were there with them. </p>

            <p>The five remaining chicks on Sunday lets hope   							they survive but I have heard people saying do we   							want a duck so maybe someone is taking them home not   							the thing to do with wild ducks and they need their   							mother at this stage.

            <p>Last week the swans built a nest by the Tipkinder   							bridge but they have abandoned it and started again   							down by the golf coarse end of the lake. I suppose   							they have been disturbed down the other end as we   							have had lots of reports of yobs chasing the ducks   							recently. The problem were they have started again   							is people let dogs off the lead down there and its   							quite for the yobs to mess about. Swans and Grebe   							are protected birds and its illegal to steal eggs   							disturb them etc  and heavy penalties if you are   							caught. </p>

            <p>The Grebes are still about up to five some days.   							They to are trying to breed but cant find anywhere   							to do it. They are very hard to take pictures of as   							they are the same colour as the water and even   							professional book show poor pictures of them.

            <p><strong>The menace of dogs off the lead</strong></p>
            <p>As you can see people are still letting dogs off   							the lead these people visit regular and never have   							it on a lead or pickup after it. They take it off   							the lead around the childs play area were it can   							carry disease  or jump pup and injure a child. One   							women this week had 6 Jack Russell's off the lead   							and when I told her I was ignored. If these dogs   							attack a swan or a Grebe it can be shot. </p>

            <p> This week a Greylag goose arrived in the park.</p>
            <p>The ancestor of most domestic geese, the greylag   							is the largest and bulkiest of the wild geese native   							to the UK and Europe. In many parts of the UK it has   							been re-established by releasing birds in suitable   							areas, but the resulting flocks (often mixed with   							Canada geese) found around gravel pits, lakes and   							reservoirs all year round in southern Britain tend   							to be semi-tame and uninspiring. The native birds   							and wintering flocks found in Scotland retain the   							special appeal of truly wild geese. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Greylag geese are easily seen in lowland areas of   							the UK all year, sometimes even in suburban parks   							with lakes but especially on low-lying grassy fields   							in river valleys. Wild ones, however, are found   							mostly north of the Solway and can be seen at RSPB   							nature reserves such as Mersehead (Dumfries &amp;   							Galloway), Vane Farm (Fife) and Loch of Strathbeg   							(Grampian) from September to April. Wild breeding   							greylags can be found at Forsinard (Caithnes &amp;   							Sutherland). </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round in the south; mostly September to   							March or April where wild visitors appear in the   							north. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>
            <p>Grass, roots, cereal leaves and spilled grain </p>

            <p>On Wednesday the swans were messing about near   							Tipkinder bridge and by Friday it was evident they   							had built a nest as the swan above was sitting on it   							being very protective. This could be a problem give   							the yobs who chase ducks etc as if they mess with a   							swan which is a royal bird they can fight back. They   							dont know Kung Fu but an ancient art called I Peck   							You. You are advised to walk past them very quietly   							as they are right next to the path if you let kids   							make a lot of noise they may get chased off.  </p>

            <p>The poor old Grebe is having less luck as here   							they are building a nest close to the bank only to   							have it destroyed by kids once again we want   							desperately to get some hay bails next to the island   							were they can nest in peace. Bo the Grebe and swans   							are protected birds and heavy fines if you attack   							them. The local Police have been around this week   							after complaints of kids throwing at ducks and   							attacking them lets hope they keep up the patrols</p>

            <p> Easter comes to the Queens Park and the weather has   							been against it with it being cold and damp there   							hasnt been a lot of people in the park.

            <p> A few Nuthatch's have moved in and are breeding in    							the park this week. being small they are hard to see   							as they move about quickly and even harder to take   							photos of. They are the only British bird that walks   							down a tree forward.</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Sitta europaea </p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/nuthatches.aspx"> Nuthatches</a> (Sittidae) </p>
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>The nuthatch is a plump bird about the size of a   							great tit that resembles a small woodpecker. It is   							blue-grey above and whitish below, with chestnut on   							its sides and under its tail. It has a black stripe   							on its head, a long black pointed bill, and short   							legs. It breeds in central and southern England and   							in Wales, and is resident, with birds seldom   							travelling far from the woods where they hatch. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Best looked for in mature woods and established   							parkland in central and southern England and Wales,   							on the sides of tree trunks and underside of   							branches. Occasional sightings in Scotland. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>
            <p>Insects, hazel nuts, acorns, beechmast and other   							nuts and seed. </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p>All so seen this week the peacock butterfly </p>
            <p>Peacocks hibernate through the winter and can be   							seen in the coldest winter months, although most   							individuals become active in late March and April.   							As well as being a harbinger of the coming spring,   							Peacock butterflies are interesting in many other   							ways. They are probably the longest-lived   							butterflies in Britain, with adults surviving from   							late July, well into the following spring, perhaps   							into June. Thus, contrary to popular belief that   							butterflies only live for a few days, some Peacocks   							may live to see their 11th month (albeit having   							spent five or six months of their adult lives asleep   							in hibernation).</p>
            <p><br />
              The Peacock butterfly has fared well in recent   							years. Not only has it increased in distribution,   							pushing northwards in northern England and central   							Scotland, but populations have also increased   							significantly in size at sites monitored by   							butterfly transects. It is even emerging from   							hibernation earlier than it was 20 years ago. There   							is little shortage of food for the black, spiny   							Peacock caterpillars, which feed primarily on Common   							(stinging) Nettle, and it seems highly probable that   							the good fortunes of this butterfly are due to   							climate change.</p>
            <p>Although a common visitor to garden buddleias,   							particularly in the autumn whilst building up fat   							reserves for hibernation, Peacocks are nomadic   							butterflies that range widely though the   							countryside. They often find their preferred   							breeding habitats (large nettle beds in sheltered   							but sunny situations) in the shelter of woodland   							clearings, rides and edges.</p>
            <p>The Peacock's name comes directly from that of   							its avian namesake, thanks to the similarity between   							the eye patterns on the bird's tails and those on   							the butterfly's wings. As long ago as the late   							1600s, the butterfly was called the Peacock's Eye.   							Even the scientific name of the butterfly is derived   							from a Greek myth involving a Peacock bird.</p>

            <p>There ahs been a lot of work done this week by   							all the bridges to stop the shear drops leading to   							them as tons of top soil has been used to make the   							bank safe. I think clay would have been better with   							a bit of top soil</p>

            <p>The activity is partly due to the lottery   							visiting next week about a future grant to finish   							the paths etc. So lets hope we get it  but it will   							be to late for this year as the bid doesnt go in   							until June.

            <p> All in one day this week the grebe returned. You may   							remember last year we had for the first time a   							breading pair who laid eggs but they were destroyed.   							So far we have only spotted the one grebe lets hope   							he bring his mate with him and hopefully bread this   							year.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wrn5x3M78Q4/T1K45Fz2ryI/AAAAAAAAFBg/ugW4pyb72zY/s1600-h/DSCF5544%25255B3%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF5544" alt="DSCF5544" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-hE0XYTApyBg/T1K46NNohHI/AAAAAAAAFBk/arsYuJiCG6c/DSCF5544_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a></p>
            <p>The Barnacle goose also returned this week. It   							very strange as normally they only come in winter   							and no further south than Scotland. I think this one   							has got confused and now thinks he is a Canadian   							goose.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-4mSyEbCSCxg/T1K49sY2UII/AAAAAAAAFBw/Fq3f-_tWQXI/s1600-h/DSCF4602%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF4602" alt="DSCF4602" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-6atZX0afWSw/T1K4_om4elI/AAAAAAAAFB0/G1tO2N6fBec/DSCF4602_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="433" width="430" /></a></p>
            <p>The wild life is picking up with the chaffinch   							seen below. There are lots of tits and finch   							currently in the park along with other birds. We say   							a strange site this week as a rook took a magpie out   							of the sky just like a bird of prey and he had it   							pinned down as his mate joined in luckily the magpie   							escaped </p>
            <p>The chaffinch is the UK's second commonest   							breeding bird, and is arguably the most colourful of   							the UK's finches. Its patterned plumage helps it to   							blend in when feeding on the ground and it becomes   							most obvious when it flies, revealing a flash of   							white on the wings and white outer tail feathers. It   							does not feed openly on bird feeders - it prefers to   							hop about under the bird table or under the hedge.   							You'll usually hear chaffinches before you see them,   							with their loud song and varied calls.</p>

            <p> An exciting project got underway this week with   							local children using the Queens Park as a classroom.   							With the help of the Friends of Queens Park children   							learnt a lot of skills in a real environment. It   							covered everything from measuring the clock tower,   							how to find north, centrifugal force  and how it   							effects the play area, wild life and much more. Some   							of the activities and work sheets <a target="_blank" href="http://creweschools.pbworks.com/w/page/48925590/Queens%20Park%20Educational%20Resources"> are here</a>.</p>

            <p>The children seem to like the fun element of   							learning outside as it was a nice sunny day and its   							hoped there will be a lot more use of the park.</p>

            <p>About the only part of the park fenced off now is   							the boat jetty but these people didnt take the hint   							they broke down the barrier and took very young   							children right on the waters edge to get around the   							barrier which is there for their safety.</p>

            <p>The Grey wagtail was spotted on the lodge roof   							this week</p>
            <p>The grey wagtail is more colourful than its name   							suggests with slate grey upper parts and distinctive   							lemon yellow under-tail. Its tail is noticeably   							longer than those of pied and yellow wagtails. They   							have gradually increased their range in the past 150   							years and in the UK have expanded into the English   							lowlands from the northern and western uplands. They   							are badly affected by harsh winters, and because of   							recent moderate declines it is an Amber List   							species. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Found over most of the UK, with the exception of   							the Northern and western isles of Scotland. Likes   							fast flowing rivers in summer their greatest   							densities are in the hills of England, Scotland and   							Wales. In winter they can be seen around farmyards   							and lowland streams, even in city centres. Scarce in   							central and eastern England in summer and from   							upland areas in winter. </p>

            <p> Happy New year to all our readers and the start of a   							new year in the park. I am getting a lot of   							complaints about idiots with dogs not on the lead.   							Often these dogs run about terrorising other dogs or   							wildlife. The picture above is an idiot with the dog   							off the lead chasing all the ducks showing no   							concern for anyone else or the wildlife. If you say   							anything to most of these people you just get a   							mouthful off them. I spotted a well know councillor   							walking her dog off the lead  the other day and then   							panic when I approached with my dog who was on the   							lead.</p>
            <p>It very dangerous to let dogs loose in the park   							and people often do it on the childs play area the   							dogs maybe friendly but can jump up and knock a   							small child over. Again we need wardens there to   							stop this happening</p>
