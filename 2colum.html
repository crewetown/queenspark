            <p>Having talked to people who like myself visit the   							park everyday we have put together a master plan of   							what needs addressing in the park. Many people will   							visit the park once a week or once a month and can   							have different experiences depending on various   							factors. People who visit daily see a lot more and   							understand what goes on at all times of the day. </p>
            <p><strong>Restoration</strong></p>
            <p>Below the Monkey Hut restored a few months ago   							and the floor is now cracked and dangerous and its   							only time before kids pull it up </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-2rLa2KR1nr0/Uiu3dB61kxI/AAAAAAAAKQI/MG6t8hsdAJU/s1600-h/DSCF7310%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7310" alt="DSCF7310" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UQng6zZH0B0/Uiu3dzk1H6I/AAAAAAAAKQM/3ESMBmZHO7U/DSCF7310_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="400" width="533" /></a></p>
            <p>Everyone agrees that the park needs to be   							finished but there is little we can do about that as   							its down to the council do it but we could raise   							money from local companies to help. What is   							important that people get a say on what is done and   							don&rsquo;t turn up one day and find something they   							disagree with. Some smaller projects could be done   							by ANTS but a lot its down to a partnership with the   							council. </p>
            <p>Below the clock once again isnt working even   							after the restoration</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-e67cdmZTWzk/Uiu3er65hCI/AAAAAAAAKQY/v3VVYQRtIRo/s1600-h/DSCF8581%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF8581" alt="DSCF8581" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Lh4PMkksdtw/Uiu3fDbpaeI/AAAAAAAAKQc/vfhWTCZs-c4/DSCF8581_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="396" width="528" /></a></p>
            <p><strong>Cleaning and look of the park.</strong></p>
            <p>This is an on going problem some caused by nature   							other caused by litter and the public. Its not a one   							off problem but a daily or weekly problem and needs   							work doing on a regular basis. Droppings for the   							geese can soon make a mess of paths and this can   							happen daily. Due to lack of staff this is being   							done by volunteers and ANTS did a wonderful job at   							their weekend clean up. The problem is getting   							people doing this on a regular basis as some times   							of the year it can get worse ie winter when there   							are lots of leaves and people don&rsquo;t want to go out. </p>
            <p>Below ANTS did a wonderful job of cleaning this   							path but 3 days later its a mess its almost a daily   							chore that wants doing </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-7b3k_syzyZs/Uiu3gK2aaWI/AAAAAAAAKQo/40gOhw_fJKs/s1600-h/DSCF7313%25255B5%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF7313" alt="DSCF7313" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-7BmbJKrNLbs/Uiu3hFRrODI/AAAAAAAAKQs/VqckNW7Beks/DSCF7313_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="390" width="520" /></a></p>
            <p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
            <p>At the moment we don&rsquo;t have set projects for   							anyone volunteering we need a list of project that   							people can work on so a volunteer can come along and   							choose from a large list of projects that match   							their skills and interest. These list need to be   							well designed for instance refurbishing the lodge   							gardens the list would have to include exactly what   							the plan is so people would know what they can and   							cant do this applies to all projects. We need a big   							list so we can use all the people who want to help   							from a single person to a organisation with lots of   							people. Without this list it will be a cock up.   							People may not be able to come for a day but happy   							to pop in and do an odd hour when it suits them we   							need to make this happen so people can come in know   							what to do and get any tools etc. </p>
            <p><strong>Problems</strong></p>
            <p>Virtually everyone that comes daily has the same   							comment on problems that are not being address. Dogs   							of f the lead, illegal and dangerous fishing , bikes   							and of coarse vandals. As there are no wardens this   							is a major problem for people as no one feels safe   							in the park. Dogs off the lead is a major problem   							and there are a few that come and set the dogs on   							wildlife and are yet to be caught, some are so   							frightened of dogs they have to leave the park if   							they see them off the lead. </p>
            <p>Fishing is a major concern as its very dangerous   							kids ride bike with rods sticking out in front with   							line and hooks attached, they cast next to ducks and   							swans and two swans have suffer already if it   							happens to a duck I don&rsquo;t think the RSPCA would come   							to the rescue and it would die a horribly death. 90%   							of those fishing will have no rod licence and it is   							illegal fines can be as much as £2,500. They leave   							litter and hooks block foot paths cast near people   							and make a mess everywhere after climbing fences and   							causing criminal damage. On Health and Safety   							grounds we can allow fishing even if controlled no   							one is going to be a bailiff and be there all day   							everyday so its not enforceable. As we often have   							Grebe on the lake which is a protect species along   							with the swans fishing is dangerous for them as they   							swim a long way underwater and even a good fisherman   							wouldn&rsquo;t know it was there until it get hooked up.   							99% of regulars are against fishing and the damage   							they cause. </p>
            <p><strong>Dogs off the lead</strong></p>
            <p>Everyday you can find dogs off the lead in the   							park many will let GSD roam around the children's   							play area off the lead, they will be off the lead   							near wildlife and often chase the wildlife and under   							new laws this can be considered a dangerous dog. If   							you come to the park with a young child you dont   							want any dog big or small running about near them   							even f they dont bite they can knock a child over   							and hurt it. If like me you own a dog which you keep   							on the lead you dont want loose dogs attacking your   							dog or coming up to it barking etc. This again is an   							accident waiting to happen. A dog control order is   							being proposed for the park but again with no one   							enforcing it wont do any good. </p>
            <p>Bikes are another problem and one that causes   							confusion as its not clear if and were they can be   							ridden this needs to be made clear. Again sensible   							cyclists are not a problem but kids on BMX speeding   							down path and over the bridge are. </p>
            <p><strong>Wildlife</strong></p>
            <p>Most visitors to the park come in contact with   							the wildlife either to view them or bring the kids   							to feed them. Enough isn&rsquo;t being done to help   							wildlife last year we managed to get a pallet by the   							island and the grebe bred ok this year there was   							none as a results their nest and eggs were destroyed   							by kids and they had no young. Suitable plants for   							nesting are needed by the island away from the kids   							and rams up to the islands so wildlife can get off   							and on with their young this is low cost to do and   							would benefit everyone. A lot of wildlife is   							subjected to people throwing at them or being chased   							by dogs off the lead. </p>
            <p><strong>Vandals </strong></p>
            <p>Vandalism everyone is against that of coarse and   							it needs to be stopped. New CCTV soon to be   							installed will go some way to addressing this but as   							the park may not be on the monitoring screens all   							the time so it may well be missed unless people can   							ring and tell the control room to turn the camera   							screen on. CCTV is no good unless someone can   							respond quickly to problems. </p>
            <p><strong>New Approach </strong></p>
            <p>New approach to the problems. A there are no   							wardens no one is stopping any of this and a warden   							approach can not always work. A new way to tackle   							this education its possible a few ladies with high   							vis jackets could be more effective this is not a   							sexist remark but a practical one often its young   							kids causing problems and a man approaching them in   							this day and age can give concern about paedophiles.   							Women can often deal with the children better being   							mother them selves and often if women with a baby   							approaches a dog owner and explains she is   							frightened for her child as the dog is loose will be   							more effective. In stead of a warden approach its an   							educational approach the same applies to people   							dropping litter which then reduces the time needed   							cleaning up. </p>
            <p>At the present time these problems are not being   							addressed and to get the park back to its formal   							glory need a total approach to the whole problem not   							just some of the problems. As people see   							improvements and more people use the park so the   							problems ill reduce as lots of people in the park   							helps to reduce vandals as they don&rsquo;t like lots of   							people about. Its really not new it goes back to the   							old days when the communities would police its self   							as there was always some stern granny who would tell   							kids off and would be supported by other people. </p>
