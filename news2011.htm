                    <p>The big news is the vandals have struck  again with a   				memorial seat being smashed to fire wood and the above smashed   				in the Coronation walk. Its been highlighted in the local paper   				and Radio Stoke are doing a broadcast on it as well. This is   				mostly due to the lack of wardens in the park  and all the money   				spent will be wasted if they destroy everything thats been done.</p>

                    <p>Volunteers wanted. I visited the bench grave yard this week   				all the old benches are stacked up and un loved many only want   				minor repairs. We are after volunteers to fix them and get that   				back in the park. These are all benches that people have bought   				to remember their loved ones but they are not the councils   				responsibility  a sits up to the owners but of coarse many have   				passed away or moved. It would be nice to get them repaired and   				back into the park any wood work experts ideal anyone retired   				that could give a few hours to fix them?</p>

          <p>A Shovel duck made an appearance this week</p>
          <p>Shovelers are surface feeing ducks with huge   								spatulate bills. Males have dark green heads,   								with white breasts and chestnut flanks. Females   								are mottled brown. In flight birds show patches   								of light blue and green on their wings. In the   								UK they breed in southern and eastern England,   								especially around the Ouse Washes, the Humber   								and the North Kent Marshes, and in much smaller   								numbers in Scotland and western parts of   								England. In winter, breeding birds move south,   								and are replaced by an influx of continental   								birds from further north. The UK is home to more   								than 20% of the NW European population, making   								it an Amber List species.</p>

          <p>If you look on the clock tower you will see   								she now has a big nose. It should be a image as   								found on the penny black but they got it wrong   								and will now have to be corrected.</p>

          <p>There is good news on the cafe above we can   								see the woodland walk next to the cafe. The new   								owners of the cafe the Pickle Jar hope to have   								it open by the 22nd August maybe with a basic   								menu to start with but are hoping to put on more   								menu soon.</p>

          <p>The lake has turned a nasty green with weed   								and algae which the gardeners have been fishing   								out but it does look a mess.</p>
          <p>Sadly the Grebes seem to have gone and their   								eggs are missing as reported last week kids were   								seen trying to steal the eggs. We dont know if   								they succeeded in stealing the eggs and the   								Grebes then moved on or not but its a sad   								reflection on society when this happens.</p>

          <p> All I have heard this week is complaints from   								people about the cutting down of trees by the   								new cafe. The above picture was taken last week.</p>
          <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TaDx9ncmykI/AAAAAAAADuI/Mt7EkuNfca0/s1600-h/queenspark%20021[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 021" alt="queenspark 021" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TaDyA4_ihLI/AAAAAAAADuM/oF3jH6Y7FpY/queenspark%20021_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="172" width="226" /></a></p>
          <p>This is what it looks like this week with the   								trees gone. They have removed a lot of trees so   								the view from the cafe is better and you will be   								able to see some of the lake. From the cafe side   								you will see the picture below but from the cafe   								you will be slightly higher.</p>
          <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TaDyp1AXNCI/AAAAAAAADuQ/YKALHuKThu0/s1600-h/queenspark%20014[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 014" alt="queenspark 014" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TaDysTeHTrI/AAAAAAAADuU/1cLoTI1SCZM/queenspark%20014_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="178" width="231" /></a></p>

          <p>Above is the area next to the cafe were a lot   								of trees have been removed. What do you think   								should the trees have been removed just so you   								can get a better view?</p>

          <p>I was surprised to catch two Jays in the park   								while they are not a rare bird they are hard to   								take pictures of as they dont often break cover   								and are wary of people but with the Fugi HS10   								with 30* optical zoom I managed to catch this   								one</p>

          <p> There is work going on at the park but its hard   								to show much change from last week that can be   								seen in a picture.

            <p> Happy Xmas to all my readers remember the park is   							open Xmas day.</p>

            <p>Later in the week the council had all the paths   							resurfaced with a new type of tarmac which looked a   							lot like snow LOL. You can see how big the flakes   							were coming down and there was just me in the park   							that day.</p>

            <p> On Monday I did a Radio interview with Radio Stoke   							in the Queens park about the vandalism that has   							taken place lately.

          <div id="post-body-2209565560084833697"> Its been a funny week with Radio Stoke doing   							interview about the park this week you can still   							catch it for a few day <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00kmv4q"> here</a> I am on about 46 mins in and the Mayor is   							on a few mins latter. The main concern is there is   							no money to finish the park at the moment but a bid   							has gone to the lottery 3 weeks ago for a further   							£330,00 to finish the paths. The lottery are looking   							at adding it on to the present grant which would   							mean a quicker decision rather than applying for a   							new grant.
            <p>The paths were not on the original   							application because at the time they were ok it was   							only when Wrekin took heavy machines over them that   							they were damaged  and of coarse they went bankrupt   							so we cant get money off them.</p>
            <p>One of the thing missing that was cut from the   							interview is the increase of vandals in the park and   							if we dont get a grip all the hard work will be   							destroyed in a few months.</p>

            <p>Here we can see a 15 ft plastic pipe thrown in   							the lake retrieved by the gardeners this week there   							are plenty of other examples with dustbins and    							fences and other rubbish thrown in.

            <p> The Boar War Memorial has now had the white stones   							remove from its base. Why because parents dont seem   							to understand respect for the soldiers who gave   							their lives fighting for their country. Parent   							regularly have been letting children play on the   							memorial and kick the stones all  over the place    							and then they take pictures of them jumping on the   							Lions. Has no one got any respect for people who   							gave their lives some of the soldiers must be   							turning in their graves wondering why they gave   							their lives to be treated this way. Stand at the   							memorial and read the names of the fallen you may   							find one of your relations fought in that war and   							died. The Gulf War memorial has been destroyed by   							vandals bring back  conscription they may then   							appreciate what hardship and death is all about.</p>

            <p>A new addition this week is Moor hens</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Gallinula chloropus </p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/rails.aspx"> Rails</a> (Rallidae) </p>
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>The moorhen is a medium-sized, ground-dwelling   							bird, that is usually found near water. From a   							distance it looks black with a ragged white line   							along its body. Up close it is olive-brown on the   							back and the head and underneath are blue-grey. It   							has a red bill with a yellow tip. It breeds in the   							UK in lowland areas, especially in central and   							eastern England. It is scarce in northern Scotland   							and the uplands of Wales and northern England. UK   							breeding birds are residents and seldom travel far. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>There's a chance of seeing a moorhen anywhere   							where there is water - from a small ditch or a lake   							in a city centre park, to a big lake or reservoir. </p>

            <p>The main talking point this week is the wardens   							with the Chronicle and the Guardian carrying the   							story. We are still down to one warden and this week   							even security suffered when a young 8 year old child   							smashed his window in his car. His father just hung   							up when he was approached on paying for the damage.</p>

            <p><em>Good Afternoon Councillor Sylvester,</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><em>Apologies for the slow response. As Phil has   							alluded to in his e-mail, with the reduction in the   							Council&rsquo;s overall budget, changes to operations have   							been required of many services and this has meant   							that difficult decisions have had to be made. Along   							with grounds maintenance the  Greenspaces service   							has  also had to achieve significant savings  and   							unfortunately the loss of the park wardens along   							with a number of rangers through a staff restructure   							has been necessary . In  normal circumstances this   							is clearly not something we would have done. As part   							of the ongoing redevelopment within Queen&rsquo;s Park we   							had planned to review the way that the park wardens   							worked,  we were considering making changes by   							converting the Wardens to Park Rangers and making   							their role far more positive and community focused.   							The objective being to help further stimulate the   							community activity in the park and thus displace the   							anti social, vandalism and misuse that are   							perpetrated by a minority of the local community.   							However as outlined above the need to make   							significant reductions to our expenditure prevents   							this at the present time. </em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><em>As you know through the project work and   							support to the development of the Friends of Queen&rsquo;s   							Park we are all committed to making this a success   							and our staff input is therefore still very   							significant. It is staffed at present with a Park   							Manager and four full time gardeners with an input   							from the Streetscape Area and Technical Teams to   							support the maintenance activities. The Park Manager   							has direct support from her team of 3 park   							management officers in the new structure and will   							receive support from the Council&rsquo;s Countryside   							Ranger and Play teams to help with the delivery of   							activity programmes. The park buildings will be   							maintained by the Council&rsquo;s Asset Management team.   							At the present time it is also our intention to   							retain the existing security company who I   							understand have been involved over a number of years   							in Queens Park including out of hours call outs,   							special events and other times as required.</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><em>The problems of misuse and abuse of the park   							are not new and have been continuous despite the   							presence of the Park Wardens. Cheshire East Council   							are committed to trying to resolve these issues  and   							are, despite the challenges, looking to find   							different approaches to do this. The Park Manager is   							engaged in forming a broad based partnership of   							organisations and the community that will join   							together with this as its core objective. It may   							take time to resolve what has become an entrenched   							problem but we believe that this is the only way   							forward. It has worked in other parks. To date we   							have met with the Police and other Partnership   							organisations twice and will continue to focus on   							this issue looking to make progress. In addition,   							with the appointment of operators of the café and   							the imminent reopening of the offices in the West   							Lodge there will be a regular presence in the park   							to further deter nuisance behaviour.</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><em>I understand that clearly there continues to   							be concern about this issue particularly given the   							current investment and positive work that is being   							done by the Friends of the Park but hopefully the   							above has explained that despite the budget   							challenges we fully intend to ensure that the   							benefit of this investment </em>is realized for the   							local community of Crewe. </p>
            <p>Thanks </p>

            <p>One of the side effects of the royal visit is the   							barriers were taken down for the day and people took   							the opportunity to get around the park like the   							south side were the Grebes are on the nest and this   							has caused problems as the mother has been disturbed   							and kept jumping off the nest.</p>

            <p>The cafe is now finished apart from odd little   							bits to be fixed and I managed to get a shot from   							the other side of the lake. As most of the effort   							this week has been the visit and putting fences back   							there isnt a lot more to report this week</p>

            <p> The Queens Park had a Royal visitor this week. </p>
            <p>Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester (Birgitte Eva;   							formerly van Deurs; born Henriksen, 20 June 1946) is   							a member of the British Royal Family, the wife of   							Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who is a   							grandchild of King George V.</p>
            <p>Together with her husband, the Duchess of   							Gloucester undertakes royal duties on behalf of the   							Duke's cousin, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
            <p>The Duchess of Gloucester is patron of a large   							number of organizations, many of which have medical,   							educational or welfare connections. She has also   							accompanied the Duke of Gloucester on his official   							visits overseas: her first such visit was in 1973,   							when The Duke and Duchess represented The Queen at   							the 70th birthday celebrations of King Olav V of   							Norway.</p>
            <p>The Duchess is sponsor of two Royal Navy Ships:   							HMS Gloucester and HMS Sandown. The Duchess is the   							patron of Bliss, the special care baby charity. She   							is also patron of St Paul's Cathedral School, St   							John's School, Leatherhead and Bridewell Royal   							Hospital (King Edward's School, Witley) and   							regularly attends functions at all three schools.</p>
            <p>After the death of Princess Diana she became the   							president of the Royal Academy of Music.</p>

            <p>A medium-sized, sociable goose, with black head,   							neck and breast with creamy-white face, which   							contrasts with the white belly, blue-grey barred   							back and black tail.

            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Largest numbers on the Solway Firth (England and   							Scotland) and on Islay, Scotland. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>October until March. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>

            <p>We have a nesting pair with a few eggs visible in   							the nest. </p>
            <p>Small to medium-sized water birds, characterised   							by their pointed bills (long and dagger-like in   							larger species), round bodies, tiny tails and legs   							set far back on the body. </p>
            <p>The legs are flattened and the toes have broad,   							leaf-like lobes, so that the forward stroke   							underwater has minimum drag but the backward stroke   							can exert maximum pressure for forward movement.  </p>
            <p>They are expert swimmers and divers but unable to   							walk on dry land. They build floating nests anchored   							to aquatic vegetation. Many other species are found   							almost worldwide </p>
            <p>They have an elaborate courtship display in which   							they rise out of the water and shake their heads.   							Very young grebes often ride on their parents'   							backs. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Lowland lakes, gravel pits, reservoirs and   							rivers. Also found along coasts in winter. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round </p>

            <p>Reaseheath College is joining forces with Crewe   							and Nantwich Horticulture Society to present a   							fabulous local produce and activities show,   							including demonstrations. </p>
            <p>The climax to the day will be a huge pyrotechnic   							show including fireworks, flame shapes, gas jets and   							special effects from 9pm. Arena activities start at   							4pm. </p>
            <p>Councillor Rod Menlove, Cabinet member with   							responsibility for environmental services, said:   							&ldquo;This is set to be a great day and with so many   							events on offer, there is sure to be something for   							everyone. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;In Queens Park, the town, along with Cheshire   							East, has a great asset and it is only right that we   							celebrate the excellent restoration work that has   							been carried out there.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Councillor Roy Cartlidge, ward member for Crewe   							St. Barnabas and Crewe Mayor, said: &ldquo;Events like   							this really bring the community together and it is   							only right that we celebrate Crewe&rsquo;s rich heritage   							and exciting future. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;I would also like to encourage people to dress   							in Victorian period clothing for the day. I will be   							easy to spot in a top hat and waistcoat and I am   							looking forward to seeing the other outfits on   							show.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>This week has been mad with everything happening   							all at once in a prelude to the royal visit next   							week. Its hard to know were to start so starting at   							the main gate they have been cleaned up and looking   							good.</p>

            <p>Another duck was out and about showing off her   							new family this week. There has been a lot of babies   							this time. What was shocking that as myself and   							another lady stood feeding the babies a child of   							about 3-4 years old came up and tried to kick the   							babies as his mother stood there saying nothing. Its   							surprising how many parents let their children chase   							the poor baby ducks. It a sad reflection on society   							were people have no respect for wildlife and what   							will these children grow up to become if parents   							allow it?

            <p>At the main entrance the clock tower renovations   							has started as scaffolding has been put up around it   							for work to begin.

            <p>A worrying development is the lake as you can see   							above the warm weather has brought out the weeds   							which are popping up all over the lake. The problem   							was the lake was dredged and then when the   							contractors went bust it was left without water for   							a long time and weeds started to grow. We are now   							seeing the results of this in the lake. I dont know   							if it can be removed by weed killer now there are   							fish in the lake or if it can be removed without   							draining we will wait and see but if its not talked   							it may take over the lake</p>
            <p><strong>A very Sad Tale</strong></p>
            <p>We live in a sick society and this case does   							highlight why the park needs wardens. Some time ago   							we mention an old  man affectionately know as   							squirrel man. This man could be seen everyday in the   							park come rain shine and even when there was snow   							and ice and –20 he sat by the lake feeding the   							wildlife who ate out of his hand. He has not been   							seen for a while but it came to light why this week.   							Apparently some very sick young individuals  started   							demanding he give them money and as a result he is   							to afraid to come to the park any more.</p>
            <p>It goes without saying if you see anything like   							this or know these yobs call the Police and lets get   							them locked up </p>

            <p> This week shows why we need the park Wardens. Above   							the fence has been wrecked as people force their way   							into the park. we have had kids swimming in the lake   							while other stood on Burma Island throwing rock into   							the lake. We have had motor bikes chasing around the   							park so its essential we have wardens.</p>
            <p>We have had a reply about the wardens from Cllr   							Andrew.Knowles</p>
            <p>There has been gross misleading information being   							circulated about re Rangers/Wardens in relation to   							Queens Park I want to emphasise and I quote &ldquo;In   							terms of the future operation of Queens Park once   							the restoration is complete the Council will have   							staff in place as part of the Management Plan which   							has been agreed with the HLF,this also includes a   							Queens Park Manager. There will be both rangers and   							a parks officer who will have a permanent base and   							presence in Queens Park</p>
            <p>I hope this clears up any rumours</p>
            <p>We have asked him to clarify some points as the   							wardens have received redundancy notices yet he says   							there will be rangers. As soon as we get more info   							we will let you know whats happening.</p>

            <p>I wonder if anyone knows that from June there   							are no Park Rangers. One sadly passed away a few   							months ago and there are no plans to replace him,   							another has already been made redundant and the   							third retires in June and again there are no plans   							for a replacement. I also believe that the external   							security company brought in by the Council to add   							additional security when the ranger's are off duty   							has also had the contract cancelled. An open   							invitation for all the undesirables to wreck all the   							good work in a very short space of time. I wonder if   							the Heritage Lottery hierarchy are aware of this. I   							would have thought that there were conditions   							attached to the bid that required the Council to   							commit staff to protect the park!</p>
            <p>The wardens carry out many task open and shutting   							the park, controlling yobs and security, provide   							first aid, ensure any events have all they need to   							be able to carry out the event. They keep the park   							clean report faults and many other functions.</p>
            <p>If they go the 6.5million spent will rapidly go   							down the pan as yobs start wrecking the park. What   							if you are taken ill or have an accident who will be   							there to save your life?</p>
            <p>Its hard to see how they can be made redundant as   							someone must perform these task and if anyone does   							then the Wardens haven&rsquo;t been made redundant but   							have suffered wrongful dismissal. To make someone   							redundant the job most have gone. Its not clear what   							the intentions are for the Queens Park but there was   							talk about leaving it open 24/7 while this may work   							in other posh areas in Crewe it will be wrecked   							within a week. Why spend 6.5 million to get the park   							right and then leave it to yobs to wreck.</p>
            <p>The cost of the wardens is a drop in the ocean   							and not great saving are to be achieved by this   							move. Everyone is up in arms that knows about this   							and I visit the Queens Park daily and everyone is   							against loosing the wardens this could be the   							election big issue.</p>

            <p> There has been a few complaints this week about   							what's happening at the park. Firstly a lot of trees   							are being removed by the new cafe and by the lake so   							you can get a betters view of the lake etc from the   							new cafe. About 6 have already been felled and there   							are more to come. Many people don't agree that trees   							that have been around for year should be felled in   							this way what do you think?</p>
            <p>The second problem is that one of the park   							keepers is finishing in June and wont be replaced   							and there has been discussions going on if the other   							park keeper will have to go. How the park will be   							protected and who will be there to help people is   							still open to debate. Having spent 6.5 million on   							the park don't we need someone to look after it and   							be there to help?</p>
            <p>Thirdly its believed that firm who have done the   							cycle track to Nantwich have agreed to do the main   							paths in the park on condition bikes can go in the   							park. Again many fear the BMX will then come in and   							put people in danger. While sensible bikers maybe   							fine what about idiots?</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TZe1MqwoNRI/AAAAAAAADsk/6PfyRn_QeVc/s1600-h/queenspark%20011[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 011" alt="queenspark 011" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TZe1NdOpCBI/AAAAAAAADss/f8P0PgdF0Lg/queenspark%20011_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="339" width="451" /></a></p>
            <p>The bowls hut is getting close to being finished   							as a new Zinc roof goes on and the main veranda is   							now in place. Lets hope its open for the new season.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TZe1ShytwGI/AAAAAAAADsw/2VFVT2KLU-E/s1600-h/queenspark%20013[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 013" alt="queenspark 013" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TZe1Tbi_pOI/AAAAAAAADs0/HxIKAcW7wek/queenspark%20013_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="337" width="449" /></a></p>
            <p>The lodges are having a roof maker over as you   							can see. As a lot of the work is behind covered   							safety sheets there is not a lot to see.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TZe1auxqwLI/AAAAAAAADs8/T7HOaKHYrkY/s1600-h/queenspark%20022[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 022" alt="queenspark 022" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TZe1bqLIyNI/AAAAAAAADtA/GrAxfKXnX_4/queenspark%20022_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="347" width="462" /></a></p>
            <p>The cafe roof is now not far off being done its   							seems to have taken forever to do the roof but its   							now looking good with all the daffs out(wonder how   							many will be left after mothering Sunday). Once the   							roof is done there isn't a lot of work to do inside   							as its a big open space.</p>
            <p>The Boar war work has ground to a halt at the   							moment.</p>

            <p> The Boer War Memorial has had the base uncovered as   							part of the restoration. It has been covered for at   							least 35 years as we have photos showing it covered   							at that time how long before that it was covered we   							are not sure. What was amazing was that someone had   							covered the old bolts in grease and cloth all those   							years ago and now they are as new.</p>

              Friends Chairperson&rsquo;s Update and works in   							progress <br />
              Derek Morgan presented his report. <br />
              ( Comments and questions arising are itemised below   							) </p>
            <p>i. Pavilions – Contractor &lsquo;Tolent&rsquo; <br />
              Completion expected early May. Weather much better   							and some construction time has been caught up, but   							some time has been lost due to recent theft of   							recently installed electricity cables (copper   							value). The roof structure and walls are approaching   							completion and the internal works are in progress.</p>
            <p>ii. Lodges- Contractor &lsquo;ISG&rsquo; <br />
              A 16 week programme commencing 31st January and   							completion date is 20th May.  A good start has been   							made with the site compound fenced off, cabins   							installed, scaffolding erected, demolition of   							non-original extensions completed and some stone   							cleaning underway.  A temporary access has been   							created 50 yds from the Lodge to assist users of the   							Park - it has been signed accordingly at both   							entrances.</p>
            <p>iii. Structures – Contractor &lsquo;Maysand&rsquo;</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaPgivxXJI/AAAAAAAADpg/PLspzb3AFJ8/s1600-h/queenspark%20021[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 021" alt="queenspark 021" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaPh98_FQI/AAAAAAAADpo/1BR7OH87-gg/queenspark%20021_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="337" width="449" /></a> <br />
              The scope of works, for this contractor, includes   							the restoration of the Clock Tower, Boer War   							memorial, the monkey shelter (Southern Timber   							Shelter) and Play Area Shelter.  Works commence on   							the 14th March; completion date and programme are   							not known yet but probably about 12 weeks.</p>
            <p>iv. Play Area- Contractor: County Landscapes <br />
              There are some defects still to be made good and a   							new path linking gym equipment is proposed,  plus   							removal of old play area agreed. Timescale is likely   							to be approximately four to six weeks and should   							commence on 14th March.</p>
            <p>v. Footpaths <br />
              Costs for footpath works are due within the next two   							weeks, following which we will be able to agree the   							scope of works, programme, finalise costs and decide   							which contractors will be involved.</p>
            <p>vi. Connect 2 Works</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaPod4MctI/AAAAAAAADps/6eDPg_I4LsY/s1600-h/queenspark%20024[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 024" alt="queenspark 024" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaPpGZqSGI/AAAAAAAADp0/wIKdmuhe_YA/queenspark%20024_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a> <br />
              The traffic calming works and Tipkinder crossing is   							underway this week with a new cycleway across   							Tipkinder. Access for disabled drivers is possible   							but a bit restricted until the new access road   							through the depot is formed as part of the footpath   							works later in the summer.</p>
            <p>LAKE</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaPwM7xwaI/AAAAAAAADp4/c6JXS-9gM7k/s1600-h/queenspark%20036[4].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 036" alt="queenspark 036" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaPw0WHD4I/AAAAAAAADp8/28Tx1gQCaL8/queenspark%20036_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="337" width="449" /></a></p>
            <p>The Weeping Willow just coming into leaf looking   							good</p>
            <p><br />
              Fish are to be returned this month. Following checks   							it appears that there has been a lot of poaching of   							the large carp. When the holding pool is partially   							drained it will be possible to determine how many   							large carp are left. A health check requires ten   							fish, so assuming there are only fifteen it would be   							better to give them away to our partner angling   							clubs and purchase a new healthy stock.  This will   							be investigated.</p>
            <p>CAFETERIA PROCUREMENT</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaP3GB0DhI/AAAAAAAADqA/KXE1hjyqF60/s1600-h/queenspark%20013[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 013" alt="queenspark 013" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TYaRP-f4NcI/AAAAAAAADqE/g7T89yIe4Rs/queenspark%20013_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a> <br />
              The Queens Park Cafeteria Services was recently   							advertised via the Councils procurement process,   							however, the contact was linked to three park sites   							of which CEC has received an objection.  We await   							legal advice on how this will be resolved and will   							let the group know in due course.  <br />
              The Parks Manager has applied for a Cafeteria   							Licence for the sale of alcohol and to utilise the   							venue for entertainment to increase opportunities to   							maximise footfall through events, functions and   							refreshment sales.  Maximum opening hours the   							cafeteria could potentially operate is between 8am –   							2am with alcohol and hot food sales up to 1am --   							again to facilitate the venue fully for functions   							and events. We will invite the successful   							contractor  to introduce themselves to a future   							Friends meeting once the contract details are   							confirmed.</p>
            <p>POTENTIAL RE-OPENING EVENT <br />
              No Palace confirmation has been received.    							Therefore, it is proposed to plan for the <br />
              re-opening possibly on the second Saturday of   							September.  This will allow sufficient time to make   							the event arrangements and engage with the   							community.  Also, the Park will be much closer to   							completion.  Should the Palace confirm, separate   							arrangements for an appropriate event/display will   							need to be arranged.</p>
            <p>The heritage lottery visited the site to discuss   							the Managers initial pre grant application.  Whilst   							that went well, they require longevity of activities   							to be confirmed.  Given the restricted resources   							available in terms of administration we are not sure   							how practical this is.   The grant application was   							£15k; however, some limited monies have been   							identified within the project which would ease the   							event arrangements considerably.  <br />
              Key events would include a re-creation of the   							original procession which entered the Park.  Already   							discussions are underway with local art workers to   							produce costumes with school children to recreate   							this, a marching band and fireman&rsquo;s arch echoing the   							event of some 120+ years ago.  The later date makes   							school involvement possible.  Plus, Victorian themed   							side shows.... budget permitting.  And, concluding   							with a pyro-show, the like of which most local   							residents would not have seen.  This would be an   							interpretation of Crewe evolving from an industrial   							engineering town into today&rsquo;s more modern economy.    							We await to confirm availability of this   							performance.</p>
            <p>5.0    HLF Agreed Project Extension <br />
              HLF has agreed to extend the expiry date until the   							end of September. <br />

              9.0    AOB <br />
              Q: Is the Tipkinder Car park to be resurfaced? <br />
              A: (A. Leah) no money is available for resurfacing   							or bay marking etc – to undertake this project would   							take monies from the paths in the park. The problems   							with the TipKinder car park are problems with holes,   							rather than a need to resurface – finding filler for   							these can probably be arranged. <br />
              Park access for events and disabled drivers will   							change as the paths are completed – there will be no   							vehicle access via the east gate when the project is   							finished. <br />
              To the west, the new Cycleway needs soil and   							reseeding from the Golf Club area.</p>
            <p>Opening of south and west gates: The gates are   							being fabricated. The final costing for   							refurbishment of paths is greater than foreseen.   							This is partly because some of the paths were not    							originally well-constructed. It is envisaged that   							the paths project will enable a link norh –south and   							east –west through the park and across the bridges.   							Other paths might have to be given a temporary   							surface until further funding is available.</p>
            <p>Q: When will the Games Pavilion be completed? The   							season begins on April 1st. <br />
              A: It is scheduled for completion by 1st May and   							won&rsquo;t be far off completion when the season starts.   							Temporary facilities will be confirmed in the   							interim – Elaine to arrange.</p>
            <p>Q: When will there be access to Burma Star Island   							and use of that bridge? Could the barriers be   							removed so that the bridge can be used as a viewing   							platform? <br />
              A: It will be linked to the forthcoming footpath   							project and  take into account changing levels and   							gradients, plus some changes to footpath layout.    							The viewing platform suggestion will be considered.</p>
            <p>Q: Will the large roof space area of the new   							pavilion be utilised? <br />
              A: No. As in the original plans, the beams will   							remain exposed and the open-plan design will allow a   							clear vista.</p>
            <p>Q: Is the double swing in the new playground   							dangerous? <br />
              A: It is in accordance with required health and   							safety standards – some signs about suitable age   							group of users and usage will be considered.</p>
            <p>Q: The gym equipment area gets very muddy – what   							can be done about this? <br />
              A: A path link is to be added and drainage improved.</p>
            <p>Q: What are the two Lodge houses to be used for? <br />
              A:  They will be used for offices, staff facilities   							and as a community facility with approved and signed   							disabled access and toilets.</p>
            <p>Q: What sort of re-opening event will there be?   							Will it be in place of the Carnival? <br />
              A: The event is no longer contingent on a royal   							visit (see Chair&rsquo;s notes above) but requires an   							amount of funding that is not currently available.   							Nigel Irlam suggested approaching the townspeople   							for support by staging publicity events in the town   							centres. <br />
              It was pointed out that the Friends Group, as   							organisers, is not a registered Charity.</p>
            <p>It was also suggested that a plan of action for   							the publicity be put to the Town Centre Manager by   							Nigel. <br />
              There was a further suggestion that the opening   							event should involve local community groups and   							reflect the multi-cultural society we live in. <br />
              With regards to Carnival, CEC has not approved any   							event budget.  The re-opening event is a separate   							issue and has only £10k allocated at this time with   							a further £5k contributed form Crewe Trustees.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><br />
              Q: How will children and young people be involved? <br />
              A: Elaine referred to the success of the Christmas   							Lantern Procession. If the opening goes ahead in   							September (?) there will be a Victorian Parade with   							multi-generational involvement. School-based   							workshops could begin in June. If there is to be a   							parade, a route will have to be agreed – all ideas   							are welcome! <br />
              AOB    Derek Morgan : presented the Friends Group   							with a cheque for £85, this being half the proceeds   							of Santa&rsquo;s Grotto in the Park, as agreed. He was   							thanked for all his work on this project. <br />
              He also advised the group of a September event for   							Scouts: The Monopoly Live Run with groups camping   							overnight in the Park, entertainment, a Jamboree and   							sponsored prizes. <br />
              Donations will be made to the Friends Group. <br />
              AOB    Elaine informed the group that there is to be   							a competition to name the new Pavilion and details   							will be in the Chronicle. <br />
              A time capsule will also be buried this year and   							suggestions for its contents are invited. <br />

            <p>The bowls hut is coming on with most of the wood   							now in place and its hoped it will be open for the   							new season, the grass has been cut ready to go.</p>
            <p>Some news from the Friends meeting that the work   							on the Boar War, the clock tower and the Monkey hut   							will start next week. fish have been put back into   							the lake this week but there is still more to come   							so hopefully people will be able to fish soon.   							Outside the park by Tipkinder new drains have been   							going in this week as the area is always flooded.</p>

            <p>Spotted on the lake on Saturday this Coot. I am   							not sure exactly what type it is but its new to the   							park and if you look closely you can see its ringed   							on its leg. It doesn't appear to be a common bird in   							this area.</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Fulica atra</p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/rails.aspx"> Rails</a> (Rallidae)</p>
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>All-black and larger than its cousin, the   							moorhen, it has a distinctive white beak and   							'shield' above the beak which earns it the title   							'bald'. Its feet have distinctive lobed flaps of   							skin on the toes, which act instead of webs when   							swimming. It patters noisily over the water before   							taking off and can be very aggressive towards   							others.</p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Mainly on freshwater lakes, gravel pits,   							reservoirs, rivers and town park lakes when deep   							enough. Sometimes seen offshore, especially in   							winter if freshwater areas are frozen.</p>

            <p>Work has begun to restore the gatehouse lodges   							at Queens Park to their former glory.  </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TVXQP4seAqI/AAAAAAAADjU/5dYBS2H8WyE/s1600-h/DSCF2871[4].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2871" alt="DSCF2871" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TVXQRHthseI/AAAAAAAADjY/zupSwWb3WvY/DSCF2871_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="328" width="437" /></a></p>
            <p>While the work is under way, the adjoining main   							gates on Victoria Avenue will be closed. However, a   							temporary entrance has been created 50 yards along   							the road, for pedestrian access.</p>
            <p>A total of £300,000 has been allocated for the   							refurbishment, which includes new roof cladding,   							replacement windows, porch repairs, demolition of   							extensions and structures that are not original,   							reinstatement of drainpipes and gutters to match   							originals and restoration of the garden and boundary   							walls to their original condition and location.  </p>
            <p>Both lodges will have new gas central heating   							boilers, new floor coverings and be completely   							redecorated. </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TVXQdZ8q5iI/AAAAAAAADjc/SZlt4m4Rt4s/s1600-h/DSCF2894[4].jpg"> <img title="DSCF2894" alt="DSCF2894" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TVXQe9Z0lQI/AAAAAAAADjk/EA3v_ZvvC34/DSCF2894_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="337" width="449" /></a></p>
            <p>The West Lodge will also get a disabled toilet,   							new kitchen, offices, new memorabilia room and a   							meeting room for school groups and other users.</p>
            <p>The East Lodge will be completely rewired and   							have new toilets, showers and mess facilities for   							the gardening team, offices, a training/meeting room   							for horticultural students, storage for hand tools   							and an external cleaning area for equipment within   							the walled garden. The work is due to be completed   							by the end of May.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Councillor Andrew Knowles, Cabinet member with   							responsibility for health and wellbeing, said: &ldquo;It   							is fantastic that these premises will be brought   							into park use and will benefit from the significant   							investment in the Queens Park restoration project.  </p>
            <p>&ldquo;The Heritage Lottery Fund is extremely   							supportive to help bring the exteriors of the lodges   							back largely to their original condition – which is   							great news, as we think this particular view is   							probably one of the most photographed in Crewe.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;This is another example of our determination to   							be an excellent council and work with others to   							deliver for Cheshire East and enhance the   							environment.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Crewe South Ward member Councillor Dorothy Flude   							said: &ldquo;I am very pleased to see that the two lodges   							are being brought back to their former Victorian   							glory.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The space within the West Lodge for use by   							school children is an excellent idea. It&rsquo;s good that   							schools will be encouraged to use this facility so   							youngsters can enjoy learning about the history of   							the park and the wider Crewe area as well as taking   							part in environmental and conservation activities in   							their community.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about the project, come   							to the next meting with project officers and   							consultants at Marshfield Bank Community Centre, off   							West Street, Crewe, on Wednesday, March 9, at   							5.30pm. Or, you can become a paper or email member   							by ringing Queen&rsquo;s Park manager Elaine Dodd on   							07825351808. </p>
            <p>Queens Park was renowned as one of the finest   							parks in the North West. It is undergoing a £6.5m   							transformation to bring it back to its former glory.   							The Heritage Lottery Fund is providing a £2.7m   							support grant with the rest of the investment coming   							from Cheshire East Council.</p>
            <p>Within the park&rsquo;s 45 acres are walkways, trees,   							shrubs, planting, children&rsquo;s play area, crown green   							bowling, putting, boating lake grassed areas,   							memorials and cafeteria. </p>

            <p>Work on the two lodges is now getting under way   							as lots of workmen's cabins arrive ready to start   							work and the main gate is closed(it was open today   							Friday) Work is due to go on until June.</p>

            <p>The gardeners have been buzzy cleaning all the   							rubbish etc from the bushes along the railings and   							felling several trees over the other side of the   							lake. The area looks a lot better for a tidy up.</p>

            <p>Using the new Finepix hs10 with 30* optical zoom   							I was able to get pictures of the band stand taken   							from the golf coarse. You have to admit its a good   							picture form that range and 30* comes into its own   							at times like this.</p>

            <p>On Radio Stoke on Monday they started a rumour   							that the park wasn't going to be finished you can   							here the rumours <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00d6f60/Breakfast_with_Pete_Morgan_Any_end_in_sight_for_restoration_of_Queens_Park/"> here</a></p>
            <p>I spoke to the horse mouth so to speak the   							manager of the Queens Park and there is no problem   							what has happened that the paths were all to be one   							contract but as there are different requirements for   							the paths ie the path by the lodges will all be on   							new soil and will settle in time so will need to be   							temporary paths. So what they have picked up on is   							that the contract has been stopped and changed to   							the new one were several tenders for different parts   							of the park. But she assured me the money was there   							and everything was going ahead as normal.</p>
            <p>You can see on the www<a href="http://www.crewetown.co.uk">.crewetown.co.uk</a> the main website for the park  that everything is   							progressing with work on the lodges starting next   							week.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TUNj_s3-NnI/AAAAAAAADgM/ml7Fp2dDXCI/s1600-h/queenspark%20011[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 011" alt="queenspark 011" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TUNkAq1NCuI/AAAAAAAADgU/PIH8ucBYZ_c/queenspark%20011_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a></p>
            <p>The Bowling Green roof is way underway with   							scaffolding up and lots of work on the roof and the   							veranda can now be seen.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TUNkGVOVNyI/AAAAAAAADgY/uRXydGJhAzE/s1600-h/queenspark%20022[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 022" alt="queenspark 022" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TUNkHY9bLMI/AAAAAAAADgc/eipQMWhVmsM/queenspark%20022_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a></p>
            <p>The cafe has had lots of glass put into the roof   							and really taking shape at last once the roof is on   							the weather wont effect the work so bad. With all   							that glass its will be nice and bright inside.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TUNkNXGm6CI/AAAAAAAADgg/M0g6ksLcWlA/s1600-h/queenspark%20033[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 033" alt="queenspark 033" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TUNkOWVVtPI/AAAAAAAADgk/ifm1amM7_dQ/queenspark%20033_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a></p>
            <p>Outside the cafe I caught a robin taking in the   							sun and its interesting that despite the cold   							weather you can see if you enlarge the picture by   							double clicking that the plants are slowly budding   							meaning that hopefully spring is to far away.</p>

            <p>Radio Stoke caused a panic in the park last week   							as they interviewed everyone about rumours that the   							council had run out of money and had nothing left to   							finish the park and as such the paths planting etc   							would never be finished. I contacted the park   							manager and she assured me that everything was going   							ahead as planned. If any more info comes to light we   							will be on the case.</p>
            <p>The work is still going ahead and the bowling hut   							is now getting the roof put on slowly</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TTt4TIi848I/AAAAAAAADe4/3v6ZmE67Ku4/s1600-h/queenspark%20015[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 015" alt="queenspark 015" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TTt4T8KNoQI/AAAAAAAADfA/wo6OzOnRoQc/queenspark%20015_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="393" width="523" /></a> .</p>
            <p>The cafe is also getting its roof put on and the   							glass windows at the top can be seen going in.</p>

            <p>As you come in from Tipkinder the path down to   							the lake had fencing all the way down this has now   							been removed and the area cleaned up so there is a   							little extra space.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TTt4gZBAjbI/AAAAAAAADfM/pE4XzoK7Ps8/s1600-h/queenspark%20033[3].jpg"> <img title="queenspark 033" alt="queenspark 033" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/TTt4hcP_W2I/AAAAAAAADfQ/DLhDINMQ8NU/queenspark%20033_thumb[1].jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="386" width="514" /></a></p>
            <p>The new climbing frame has now got its play   							surface put down and should be open very soon. As   							with all things at this time of year the weather is   							a major problem which can soon put things back if we   							get more snow or frost</p>

            <p>Over at the play area the new climbing frame has   							now got all the guy ropes in and the lads were   							working in the snow to get the job done.
