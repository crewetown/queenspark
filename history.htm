  <p> <strong>BLUE GREEN ALGAE IN QUEENS PARK LAKE<br />
19th July 2004</strong><br />
Recent tests by the Environment Agency on the water quality of   			Queens Park <br />
Lake have indicated high levels of Blue Green Algae. <br />
<br />
The Department of Health has stated:<br />
&quot;Illness, including skin rashes, eye irritation, vomiting,   			diarrhoea, fever, <br />
pains in muscles and joints have occurred in some recreational users   			of water <br />
who swallow or swam through algae scum. There have been no reports   			of long <br />
term effects or death in humans, but, in some cases, the illness has   			been <br />
severe.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Although algae scum is not always harmful, it is a sensible   			precaution to <br />
avoid contact with the scum and the water close to it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council has therefore been advised by the <br />
Environment Agency to suspend all boating and fishing activities on   			Queens <br />
Park Lake. <br />
<br />
Animals are also susceptible. The toxins contained in the algae are <br />
poisonous and can cause severe illness and death. It is therefore   			advised that pet owners should not allow their dogs to gain access   			to the water. <br />
Warning signs have been placed around the lake to advise members of   			the public accordingly. <br />
<br />
Said Ron Clarke, Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council's Manager for   			Grounds <br />
Maintenance: &quot;The Borough's grounds maintenance section is working   			with the <br />
Environment Agency to ensure this important leisure facility is open   			again as <br />
soon as the Agency's tests say that we can do so. Public health and   			safety <br />
considerations are our first priority.&quot; <br />
<br />
Advice on Blue Green Algae can be sought from the Environment   			Agency, <br />
Telephone 0845 933311 or Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council's   			Environmental <br />
Health Division on 01270 537424. <br />

<strong>QUEENS PARK RENEWAL ENTERS A NEW PHASE<br />
20th August 2007</strong><br />
The restoration of Crewe's historic Queens Park to its former glory   			has now moved into the construction phase. The first contractor, WM   			Plant Hire Ltd, <br />
is undertaking the lake dredging operation and started work on 30th   			July. <br />
There will be a short interruption to this work while the Park   			prepares for <br />
and hosts the traditional Crewe Carnival celebrations on Saturday   			and Sunday <br />
25th and 26th August. &quot;Despite difficult weather conditions and   			repeated oil pollution incidents, the dredging work is on schedule&quot;,   			said Alan Leah, the <br />
Borough's Landscape Architect supervising the project. &quot;We are   			working with all the relevant agencies to minimise and prevent these   			impediments to <br />
progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the dredging is being done, the reconstruction master-plan is   			being <br />
finalised, the detailed design work for the lake is under way as are   			the plans for the replacement depot, the bowls pavilion and the   			Coronation Valley <br />
Walk. Tenders for the work to the car parks and the war memorials <br />
restoration are being sought.<br />
As the dredging work nears completion, the following construction   			works will <br />
begin<br />
<br />
<br />
* New bridges, including the Broad Walk Bridge and the 4 lake   			bridges, repairs to the lake's edge and the installation of new   			oxygenating equipment<br />
* Repairs to the retaining wall on the Park's Northern boundary<br />
* New railings and gates around the Park's perimeter<br />
* Reinstatement of the bandstand<br />
<br />
<br />
An information board will be installed to explain to visitors what   			work is in progress and what is planned. From time to time, areas of   			the park will be <br />
closed for safety reasons and park users are requested to be patient   			during the construction phase of the project. Such closures may last   			for a year or <br />
longer as the work is very extensive and has required very careful   			planning. <br />
Residents of the borough will be rewarded for their patience for   			what will emerge is a public park and recreation facility that will   			be the envy of towns and cities throughout the UK. Funding for this   			major local project is <br />
being provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund.<br />
<br />
Dredging and bridge construction works represent the highest risks   			to cost and to the programme and it is good practice to begin with   			the most expensive <br />
and complex elements of the project. These early works also involve   			the largest site area and, to ensure public safety is maintained,   			the West <br />
entrance will be closed and the lake, Coronation Walk Valley, and   			the Western events areas and footpaths within these spaces will also   			be closed to the public after the Carnival. Temporary viewing   			platforms will constructed in <br />
two positions to allow for viewing of the lake works and will serve   			as a useful vantage point from which works in progress can be   			photographed on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
Borough Councillor Bill McGinnis, Portfolio Holder for Leisure,   			said: &quot;This project is a massive undertaking that will restore, to   			its original glory, what must be one of the finest town parks in the   			country. When it was dedicated in 1887 and formally opened in 1888,   			Queen Victoria was on the throne and the British Empire was at its   			peak. The park was a celebration of the area's contribution to that   			period of international prestige. When <br />
completed, our Borough's Queens Park will be a considerable tourist <br />
attraction as well as an excellent leisure facility for our   			residents.&quot;<br />

    <p align="center"> <strong>Living History from a Local Resident</strong></p>
    <p align="justify"> <br />
      I was born in 1936 and have an early recollection of the rowing and   			paddle boats off the Park lake being stored for the duration of the   			war in the changing pavilion adjacent to the tennis courts on King   			George's playing field.<br />
      My pal and I were determined to be the first on the lake when they   			were returned and this we did. I cannot remember the year but it   			must have been around 1948/9.<br />
      We carried on to help the boat attendant during our summer school   			holidays and on a Wednesday had to row a string of boats down the   			lake to the paddleboat landing stage.</p>
    <p align="justify"> <br />
    During the Summer, the lake developed a growth of stringy weed which   			wrapped itself around the paddles and left kids stranded in the   			middle of the lake. The Park Superintendent (Mr Probert) asked if we   			would like to help and we were issued with a paddle boat and two   			large wooden rakes. The plan was that we would drag up the weed, put   			it on the front of the boat and dump it over the sluice gates at the   			of the lake. A bit hazardous but no Health &amp; Safety in those days.</p>
    <p align="justify"> <br />
      During this raking operation we felt something heavy roll along the   			lake bottom and managed to lift it on the rake. What a shock when we   			saw that it was a shell from a large calibre gun. We lowered it   			gently back and reported it.<br />
      It was decided to drain the lake to investigate further and this   			revealed several pieces of hardware including shell fragments and   			small calibre ammunition. These were all located under the bridge at   			the town end of the lake.</p>
    <p align="justify"> <br />
      The lake was refilled overnight by closing the sluices and allowing   			the Valley Brook (River Waldron) to rise and overflow into the lake.   			Unfortunately the overflow at the other end of the lake became   			blocked and the lake rose above its normal level. As a result of   			this a large number of big carp swam out of the goldfish pond and   			into the lake. These were too valuable to loose so it was decided to   			drain the lake as quickly as possible resulting in many of the fish   			being stranded in the shallow pools to be collected by the gardeners   			(and us two) to be returned to their rightful pool.</p>
    <p align="justify"> <br />
      Whilst searching for these fish we spotted something flapping about   			on the raised mud bank caused by the pipe through which the Valley   			Brook normally ran under the lake.<br />
      One of the gardeners waded out and recovered a very large Pike which   			must have been four feet long and had a large piece missing from its   			tail. This monster was placed in one of the larger pools but sadly   			did not survive. The theory was that it had originated in a pool at   			Crewe Hall and had found its way down the brook when the lake was   			filled in.<br />
      We spent many happy hours on the lake working on the boats when the   			Park was in its hey-day and it is so sad to see its present   			condition.<br />
  <br />

  <strong>THE DEDICATING OF QUEENS PARK</strong></p>
    <p> There  			  			has  			  			always   			been a myth in Crewe that the LN.WR. Company gave the 36 acres of  			  			land  			  			  			to the people of the town to stop the GWR   			from building a station in the area but  the records this is   			incorrect In   			Minutes Book   			  			of   			the Board of Directors   			L.N.U.R for the 18th November 1886. it states   			  			that   			the Board had decided to   			give 36 acres of land belonging to the Railway to the Corporation of   			Crewe for a public park This was by way of celebrating two important   			occasions, the Golden jubilee of Queen Victoria and the   			  			50th   			  			anniversary of the   			Railway's   			  			involvement with the town.</p>
    <p> <br />
      There was  much excitement on the afternoon of the 4th July   1887 as the people of  the town celebrated the Dedication of Queens   Park, in conjunction with  Queen Victoria's Jubilee and the local   Jubilee of the opening of the  Grand Junction Railway 50 years ago.<br />
      Visualise and imagine the  atmosphere created that day. A   large number of Venetian masts,  streamers and flags were placed along   Victoria Avenue and all around  the park and town. Banners with &quot;Best   Wishes&quot; messages were hung from  buildings and an array of other   carefully constructed decorations could  be seen.<br />
      At 2.30pm the streets were lined with spectators  expectantly   awaiting the arrival of the Grand Procession, the highlight  of which   was the<br />
  &quot;Fireman's Arch&quot;. This was formed, by the Crewe  Volunteer   Fire Brigade, at the entrance to Victoria Avenue The arch was    constructed from fire escape ladders, decorated with bunting, shields,    mottos and the Town Council's Coat of Arms. Six men manned each fire    escape under which the procession passed, on its way to the park.<br />
      Sir  Richard Moon, Bart., the Chairman of the Railway Company,   conducted the  proceedings of the Dedication on behalf of the London   North Western  Railway Co. To mark the occasion, he was presented with a   scroll of  parchment, enclosed in a beautiful silver casket, enrolling   him as the  First Honorary Freeman of the Borough. A cascade of balloons   and a  firework display concluded the day's celebrations<br />
      A year later, on  Saturday 9th June 1888, the Park was   officially opened to the public by  HRH The Duke of Cambridge KG who, at   the time, was the Field Marshal  Commander-in-Chief for the Cheshire   Volunteers and was presented with a  suitable gold key.<br />
      Today, the Park retains the original Victorian layout as designed by            F W Webb and Edward Kemp, at a cost of £10,000 on behalf of the<br />
      LNWR Its total 45 acres is oval in shape, with a principal axis. subsidiary cross axis and a man-made lake. Cast Lodge</p>
    <p> <br />
      An  1882 map shows the site of the park lo be spread over 11   fields and  part of the sewerage works, which were closed in 1874. The   straggling  Valley Brook passes through the park and leaves the site on   the south  west corner A straight footpath crossed the site and   connected West  Street, with the park, via Coppenhall Hayes, as Victoria   Avenue had not  yet been constructed.</p>
    <p> <br />
      George Latimer, the first Custodian of the  Park from 1888 to   1906. who was succeeded by Lawrence Morgan from 1906  to 1935,   contributed greatly with his forestry expertise, leading to  the   acknowledgment that today Queens Park is one of the finest Parks in    England. Another notable contributor was Herbert W Probert whose            duties  commenced from 1935 to 1960. He was responsible for   the laying out of  the   			neighbouring King George V Playing fields and the Coronation Walk,    to commemorate the Coronation of George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937.    This is a landscaped walkway, through rock gardens beside a small    stream, which leads from the lake and winds up to the aviary.<br />
    </p>
    <p> From  1960 to 1984 the park's Superintendent was Colin Farmer,   who re-located  the greenhouse and designed such additions as the Burma   Star Island  Memorial, the Scented Garden and the Jubilee Cafeteria   Terrace. It has  been rumoured over the years that the LNWR gave the   land to prevent the  Great Western Railway from building a station in   the area. However,  this is thought to be local rumour only as we know   that the LNWR were  originally seeking to construct the line from Crewe   to Chester, which  would run alongside the Valley Brook. However, the   ground was not firm  enough and a more Northerly route was chosen. Had   this gone ahead it  would have taken the land used for Queens Park. An   entry, in the Minute  Book of the Board of Directors of the LNWR. on the   18th December 1886,  refers to the area being given for<br />
      a public park. Politics or not.  we may never know. It is only   certain that Sir Richard Moon's wishes,  in his Dedication speech, for   the park to provide pleasure and  happiness to the community for   generations to come, has to date been  fulfilled.<br />

  <br />
      TRADITIONAL BOATING LAKE<br />
  <br />
      A  notable feature is the four and a half acre. man-made lake,   which has  been beautifully landscaped into the park. Its source is the   Valley  Brook, which runs out of view under the lake, until it   reappears on the  adjacent golf course.<br />
      It was originally formed by &quot;grading in&quot; from  existing banks   and leveling off to a depth of five feet. By &quot;puddling&quot;  the clay bottom   it was made watertight and a dam at the west side was  erected. Four   bridges, originally wooden, and surrounding paths make a  popular   walking circuit around the lake. After the cultivating of  Valley Brook,   which improved the quality of the water, swimming was  permitted. By   the west island the water area was deepened to ten feet  and a diving   board and changing huts were provided but eventually  removed in 1936.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
      In 1913 a wormscrew was made in Crewe  Works to aid the   filling of the lake and this is still very much in use  today and relied   upon.<br />
  <br />
      On the south side of the park was the  Volunteer Rifle Range   with the 800 yard firing point situated near to  the Gas Works entrance   of the adjacent Railway Works. The range crossed  the future site of the   blast            furnace tip, which is now the Tipkinder Park. The target butts   were on the Valley Brook bank, to the south of Burma Star Island.</p>
    <p> <br />
      During  the last war the lake was considered a possible   location aid for German  aircraft bombing the factories, so in October   1940 the water was  drained out and the bottom camouflaged with   evergreen branches Other  branches were placed over the greenhouse,   however, by April the  evergreens were removed and the water replaced.   It now transpires that  such action was taken too late, for at the end   of September 1940 the  Germans had taken an aerial photograph of Crewe,   showing  '10K0M0TIV/FABRIK&quot; L.M.S.R&quot; and &quot;FLUG-MOTOIEWWERKE, ROLLS ROYCE   LTD&quot;.  This also shows anti-aircraft barrage balloon sites at the Old    Bandstand, Queens Park Petrol Station, opposite to St Mary's Catholic    Church. Leighton Park and Badger Avenue close to Ford Lane. The Ring    Road around Queens Park and the band of trees inside are in addition to    the lake, all very distinctive from the air.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
      During the  renowned Winter of 1963. the ice was so thick that   skaters took to the  lake. In the evening the area was floodlit and hot   food vans were well  patronised.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>BURMA STAR ISLAND</strong><br />
      In 1968 the island in the  middle of the lake was re-levelled   and landscaped with new paths and  seats, and dedicated as a permanent   Memorial to the Allied Forces who  fought in the Burma Campaign during   World War II.<br />
      The Memorial Stone, which was transported from the excavations   of the ICI Works at Runcorn, has the famous Kohima epitaph;-<br />
  &quot;When you go home tell them of in and jay for their tomorrow we gave our today&quot;<br />
      OTHER INTERESTING FACTS<br />
  <br />
      It  is interesting to note that it is said that the fossilised   remains of a  Tulip Tree, a Lepidodendron. dated back to the Ice Age -   of the  Devonian period, some 320 million years ago. is located in the   path  which leads from the Cafetena down to the lake. The fossilised   tree was  given to the Park by John Knott when he was Mayor of Crewe in   1888/9.<br />
      As  a contrast just along the path, beside the Coronation Walk   bridge, is a  twisted Willow, now at least 30 years old with its   fascinating,  contorted shape.<br />
      Additionally, one of the oldest pieces of local history is   sited along the Coronation Walk path, it is a piece of Aberdeen<br />
      Peaceful walkways granite, a very            special  remnant from the glacier age some 500 million years   ago. It was  discovered when the foundations for the original Company   works were  being excavated<br />
      During the last war. both the flowerbeds and  greenhouses   contributed towards community welfare, producing seedlings  of various   vegetables. In 1941, approximately 35,000 onions and crops  consisting   of l,049lbs of tomatoes and 512 cucumbers were grown, all of  which were   sold to 3,470 local people.<br />
  <br />
      On the night of I2th December 1974   			the original Pavilion was burnt to the ground Although the firemen   			worked through the night all that was left by morning was a pile of   			smouldering timbers The firemen had to pump water from the lake   			because the mains water supply in Victoria Avenue had been   			  			fractured by the frost.</p>

      <strong>SOUTH AFRICAN MEMORIAL</strong><br />
      <br />
      Memorial  plaques are on the four faces of the monument,   containing lists of  those who left the town of Crewe to undertake   			military duty in South  Africa. The north facing pediment has the   former Arms of the Borough  with the motto &quot;Never Behind&quot; inscribed   below the dates<br />
      1899-1902.  The bronze figure of Tommy Atkins, with rifle,   bandoleer belt, pouch  and water bottle, stands to attention at the top   of the monument. On  either side of the base, lying down, are two   full-size stone lions. At  the front of the monument, the magnificent   bronze engine model designed  by F W Webb, once stood. This is now now   proudly displayed in the foyer  of the Municipal Buildings.<br />

  <strong>VICTORIAN HERITAGE</strong><br />
      Behind  the monument is the Jubilee Cafeteria, which opened on   12th June 1977,  together with the new Bandstand This more modem   structure replaced the  original Victorian Pavilion which was burnt to   the ground on the night  of the 29th December, 1972. The Senior Fire   Officer reported there had  been a possible electricity fault. Because   the water mains had been  fractured by frost, firemen pumped water up   from the lake and although  they worked throughout the night, it was to   no avail.<br />
      On Sunday  afternoons throughout the summer, there is a long   tradition of brass  bands performing in the park, this has continued to   this day providing  music to suit all tastes and ages.<br />
      At the other end of the main  drive, at the Park's entrance,   stands the prominent Clock Tower 1888  which was donated by employees of   the Railway company. Unveiled by  James Middleton, who had the   distinction of driving the first train  into Crewe fifty years prior to   the clock donation. The tower is topped  by an elaborate support to a   weather vane. At the base of the tower, on  either side, there used to   be two drinking fountains with brass cups on  chains.<br />
      Adjacent to the Clock Tower are two stone and timber lodges,    built between 1887 - 1888 by John Brooke; not quite a pair, as the    design of the West Lodge incorporates a Bell Tower. An inscription at    the first floor level of the West Lodge commemorates the opening of    Victoria Avenue by the Commander-in-Chief H.R.H. The Duke of Cambridge.    Look on the lodge for the spider, its web and a tree, a design pun on    Francis William Webb. The inscription at first floor level of the East<br />
  <br />
      Lodge  commemorates the Jubilee of Queen Victoria and the 50th   Anniversary of  the opening of the Grand Railway Junction. You will   notice a painting  of a bat, moon and tree, in yellow and green -another   punT this time on  Sir Richard Moon Bart, Chairman of the LNWR Company.   The red sandstone  used for both lodges came from the railway cuttings   that go down to  Lime Street Station, Liverpool. These buildings are   contained on the  Department of the Environment's list of buildings of   special  architectural and historical interest Grade II.<br />
      An impressive  ornamental iron gateway stands at the entrance   where the Lodges are  located. The side gates contain the date of the   Parks dedication 1887  and the main gates have a royal crown in their   design supported by four  red stone gateposts. </p>

In 1937 the   				Aviary, which had previously been the boathouse was built, with   				funds donated by Councillor Mrs Mossford Powell, with flights   				both inside and outside the shed. Many generations of children   				and their parents have enjoyed watching and feeding the   				succession of birds and small animals. This was rebuilt in 1366   				and 1985, the former date to coincide with the opening of the   				Scented Garden, sponsored by the Lions Club of Crewe. The garden   				landscaped from an old shrubbery with new paths, borders, end a   				raised bed, all planted with scented<br />
    flowers and aromatic herbs, thus providing for the visually   				handicapped.<br />

    The popular Children's Play Area, which was refurbished in 1986   				is a comparatively new addition to the Park, originally being   				provided in the late 1950's. Under the United Nations Charter,   				children have the right to play happily and safely, and many   				thousands do so on the up-dated equipment. Swings, slides,   				roundabouts and many other items all have rubber safety surfaces   				beneath them, covering the Crewe clay mud so the whole area can   				be properly used despite the weather.<br />

    Other family activities include Crown Green Bowling on the   				carefully tended green; Crazy Golf or Putting, which have always   				been popular pastimes. For example, in 1932,13,710 players paid   				a penny for a round, and no doubt enjoyed it. Other games   				include Giant Chess and Draughts, alt contained within the same   				area.<br />
    Annual events include the Carnival and Fete, with attendance of   				up to 20,000 people which, in the early days, was held to raise   				money for the local hospital and the proceeds from the recently   				introduced Traction Engine Rallies go towards the Wybunbury   				Tower Preservation Fund;Sports Week Fete, Burma Star Memorial   				Sunday and other focal Charity events, to name but a few. Of   				course, during 1987 -Heritage Year - there will be seven   				weekends of Centenary activities with entertainment to suit all   				tastes and ages.</p>

      <br />
Memorial plaques are on the four faces of the monument, containing lists   		of <br />
those who left the town of Crewe in October 1899 to undertake duty in   		South <br />
Africa. The north facing pediment has the former Arms of the Borough   		with the <br />

<br />
On either side of the base, lying down, are two full-size stone lions.   		At the <br />
front of the monument, the magnificent model bronze engine built by a   		Crewe <br />
Works Fitter Harry Lightfoot once stood. This is now on permanent   		display in <br />

<strong>NEW AVENUE OF TREES FOR PARK</strong> <strong>28 February 2007</strong><br />
<br />
Forty semi mature Lime trees were planted this week as part of the   		latest <br />
stage in the £3.7m Heritage Lottery Funded Restoration of Queen's Park.<br />
<br />
The trees, which have been planted to form a formal avenue, were sourced   		from <br />
local nursery Specimen Trees of High Legh and were specifically chosen   		for <br />
their high quality, longevity and the long tradition of using them to   		create <br />
formal avenues.<br />
<br />
A number of mature trees within the park have had to be removed for   		various <br />
reasons such as disease or for public safety. Some conifers have also   		been <br />
felled as they were obscuring important monuments or views.<br />
<br />
Portfolio Holder for the Local Environment, Councillor John Hammond   		said: <br />
&quot;The planting of this avenue of Lime trees marks another important stage   		in <br />
the renovation of Queen's Park. It will form an impressive feature in   		the <br />
park and signifies the start of a return to its former glory. This is a   		long <br />
term project. The full effect of the work won't be seen immediately as   		the trees will need to mature. I hope that people will be able to   		visualise how glorious it will look in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Portfolio Holder for Leisure, Councillor Bill McGinnis added: &quot;The <br />
restoration of Queen's Park is a major project and signals this   		Council's <br />
intent to enhance our open spaces and provide first rate facilities for <br />
people to enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mayor Howard Curran added: &quot;We're fortunate that the money from the   		Heritage <br />
Lottery Fund is giving us the opportunity to restore this historic park   		to <br />
its former glory. There are still people living in Crewe who remember   		how stunning the park used to be and I'm pleased that future generations   		are <br />
getting the opportunity to feel as proud of the park as I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allan Leah, Queen's Park Restoration Project Officer added: &quot;For those   		who <br />
wish to be more actively involved in and informed of the restoration <br />
proposals we have set up a Stakeholder Group and a number of smaller   		user <br />
groups such as the Anglers, Schools and Friends groups. We're always   		looking <br />
for new members to join the groups.&quot;<br />
