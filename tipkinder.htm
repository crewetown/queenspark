	    <p> </p>
	    <p>We had a meeting on Friday with <em>Mike Taylor, </em>Crewe Mayor Dorothy Flude<em>, Elaine Dodd and Cllr Andrew Knowles</em> and <a href="http://www.crewe.tv/">Crewe Blog</a> at Tipkinder to promote the site and get improvements done.<br />
	      <br />
	      Everyone  was surprised by the area and the   potential it has situated so near the  the Queens Park. So many people   go the Queens Park and don't even know  the walk if a few feet away.<br />
	      <br />
	      Everyone agreed that the site wanted promoting   and there was work to be done in the area and it should start straight   away.<br />
	      The  paths will be cleared and the rubbish   removed as soon as possible and  the trees made safe. It was a timely   meeting as the next day a massive  tree collapsed in the area I am sure   that will be dealt with ASAP.<br />
	      <br />
	      The  long term plans depend on several issues   like funding and consulting  with all interested parties like local   residents. Its not a simple  matter to manage the area as new trees want   planting, old trees felled  or pruned and new plants to encourage wild   life into the area.<br />
	      <br />
	      Its  hoped the Countryside Rangers can be   appointed to look after the site  as they can do weekly inspection   advise members of the public etc.<br />
	      The  car park which is used when going to the   Queens Park will be revamped  and traffic lights installed to make it   safer for children to cross the  road.<br />
	      More details of the meeting are over on <a href="http://www.crewe.tv/">Crewe Blog</a><br />

            Firstly  good news Andrew Knowles has taken a great   interest in the project and  is meeting with us at Tipkinder this week   to see for himself what can  be done also Dorothy Flude is taking a   great interest in the project so  its all good news. Andrew is attending   the area on Friday so if you  have an interest in the area and wish to   express your views of  Tipkinder email me ASAP and we can arrange for   your input <br />
            <br />
            To  get an idea of what could be done I walked over   the road from Tipkinder  down over the golf coarse to the other woodland   area that goes down as  far as the Rising Sun. It does show what can be   achieved. The first  thing that hits you is people have dumped rubbish   in the stream  spoiling it for everyone (another job for Caroline) but   you all ways  get that.<br />
            <br />
            <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdURBbTRKI/AAAAAAAAAhI/xBgExZBCKpk/s1600-h/2009_0510Image0015.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdURBbTRKI/AAAAAAAAAhI/xBgExZBCKpk/s400/2009_0510Image0015.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334324935061095586" border="0" /></a><br />
            <br />
            They have even got a map of the area showing points of interest and wild life so you know what to look for.<br />
            <br />
            <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdUBaBqeOI/AAAAAAAAAhA/tbYsW7DwNAY/s1600-h/2009_0510Image0008.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdUBaBqeOI/AAAAAAAAAhA/tbYsW7DwNAY/s400/2009_0510Image0008.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334324666786543842" border="0" /></a><br />
            <br />
            Its well managed with proper paths and even seats for people to have a sit down<br />
            <br />
            <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdTw2_5usI/AAAAAAAAAg4/3EmCAl9_jFk/s1600-h/2009_0510Image0013.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdTw2_5usI/AAAAAAAAAg4/3EmCAl9_jFk/s400/2009_0510Image0013.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334324382506007234" border="0" /></a><br />
            <br />
            Like  Tipkinder it follows the stream and is a lovely   walk with new bridges  with a woodland area and several paths going off   in all directions<br />
            <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdTb7gaMVI/AAAAAAAAAgw/O6VM4tLf9wc/s1600-h/2009_0510Image0002.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SgdTb7gaMVI/AAAAAAAAAgw/O6VM4tLf9wc/s400/2009_0510Image0002.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334324022938841426" border="0" /></a><br />
            <br />
            It  hits the right balance of being well kept and walk   able but keeping the  right balance with wild life and nature. So with   this path you could  start at the Rising Sun and walk all the way to   town via Tipkinder and  Valley Park barley touching a street.<br />
            <br />
            If you haven't walk this  area I suggest you take a   look as you are missing out on a real treat.  Lets hope we can get   Tipkinder up to the same standard. Why isn't Crewe  publicizing this its   a great asset and deserves more publicity </p>

            Anyone seen the tree fella? <br />
            <br />
            Take  a look at the picture of the Tipkinder woodland   walk then scroll down  to the picture taken a week ago notice anything?   You will see that  Caroline has got the big whip out and got the Grounds   Maintenance out  rapidly and they have felled 3 dead poplars along the   path towards the  car park end.<br />
            <br />
            We have been highlighting the Tipkinder area along with <a href="http://www.crewe.tv/">Crewe Blog</a> who has a video of the area on the blog. We have asked Cllrs Roy    Cartlidge, Dorothy Flude, Andrew Knowles, Brian Silvester to help    improve the area.<br />
            <br />
            What&rsquo;s needed Short term for this summer?<br />
            1 The main path cleared of nettles and brambles and kept that way.<br />
            2 Rubbish removed from the river<br />
            3 Any dead and dangerous trees made safe.<br />
            4 Signs and publicity to show people what they are missing<br />
            <br />
            Caroline  Yoxall Cleansing Supervisor Cheshire East   Council and the Probation  Service have moved quickly and the Probation   Service is to clear the  paths and remove the rubbish from the river,   and Caroline has got the  council to inspect the trees. So there is   progress already.<br />
            <br />
            Both  Groundwork Cheshire and the local Valley Brook   Residents Association  (the &ldquo;river&rdquo; in the pictures is called Valley   Brook locally) had drawn  up plans for possible footpath and other   improvements adjacent to the  riverside including removal of overgrown   areas and more appropriate  tree and shrub planting schemes.   Unfortunately in lieu of being able to  identify the necessary funding,   these plans have never to date been  implemented.<br />
            <br />
            What&rsquo;s needed Long Term?<br />
            1 The path by the stream cleared so it&rsquo;s usable and strengthen the bank.<br />
            2 Other paths in the area cleared.<br />
            3 Seats not fancy seats but suitable for the area ie posts in the ground and rustic tops<br />
            4 Steps for steep area for disabled<br />
            5 Proper paths made of gravel like the have done the   other side of the golf coarse were there is a nature trail.<br />
            6 Better planting in keeping with the area to make it a spectacular walk.<br />
            7 Rustic tables for a picnic area<br />
            8 Other suggestions for the bottom field to fit in with the BMX and SK8 parks.<br />
            9  The big one connect Tipkinder to Queens Park via a   bridge as its not  safe crossing the road this would in effect extend   the park.<br />
            <br />
            Funding anyone got any money?<br />
            <br />
            How  much will all this cost? Well not very much most   of it is down to man  power in any shape or form ie Probation Services,   Volunteers,  Unemployed Schemes, Council workers. Really that&rsquo;s all   that&rsquo;s needed  for most of it the only cost would be planting of new   shrubs and gravel  for the paths. I bet places like <a href="http://www.bridgemere.co.uk/">Bridgemere Garden Center </a>would cough up the plants if they get an advert?<br />
            <br />
            There is the big answer <a href="http://www.reaseheath.ac.uk/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx">Reaseheath  College</a> I used to be a head gardener at a 32 acre site with woods and the    college who have 1,000 of student studying trees, country side,    propagation etc jumped at the chance to get their student down to learn    in a real work environment and they have all the expertise to do a    fantastic job maybe for free? I mentioned this and the old H&amp;S came    into the conversation well as the college is one of the top in the UK    they know more about H&amp;S than most.<br />
            <br />
            While they are at  Tipkinder why don&rsquo;t they get   involved in the Queens Park designing new  beds, tree management etc   lets get the job done? It cost nowt to ask  them and the publicity for   all is just what is needed for the promotion  of the area.<br />
            <br />
            The Tipkinder Project could bring people in for miles   around and be used for schools etc so who will take ownership of this   project and run with it Who will make it happen?<br />
            <br />

            The path by the river which is blocked at the moment just needs clearing but its a lovely walk </p>

          I spent the morning with Caroline Yoxall Cleansing Supervisor<br />
          Cheshire  East Council and Bill Scragg From the   Community Payback  scheme(Probation Service) to go all over Tipkinder   woodland walk. We  looked at the rubbish in the stream, overgrown paths   and dead trees.<br />
          <br />
          Bill  is going to get his team over and clear the paths   of nettles and remove  the rubbish from the stream which is difficult   because its all in the  water. If people had just dumped the rubbish on   the road it could be  removed in 5 mins as it is its a big job fishing   it out of the stream.  Thats in the short term in the long term they   will try and clear the  path along the stream and put some seats for   people to enjoy the area.<br />
          <br />
          Caroline  is going to get the trees we identified as   dead checked out ASAP as  they may be a danger and have to be felled.   Being very big some of the  trees could crash across the steam and hit   house on the other side. She  will remove all the rubbish on the banks   etc. We were looking to  promote the area as its a lovely walk in the   trees by the stream and  lots of people just dont know its there. It has   lots of wildlife for  people to enjoy and there are a few hidden walks   all around the area we  even found the secret BMX track, no not the main   one by the skate park  a secret one in the woods.<br />
          <br />
          The walk can be accessed from Colins  ST over the bridge   in the picture or from the Queens park car park or  from the BMX track   go and take a look its very nice<br />

      There  is a lovely woodland walk at the back of   Tipkinder BMX track which goes  from Collins St to the Queens Park. Its a   public walk but for years the  council havent maintained the walk and   the paths have nettles all along  the path. In a week or two the path   will be dangerous to walk as  brambles come across the path. If thats   not enough there are a lot of  trees that are dead and may fall on the   publics head, one fell across  the path last year. When the trees fall   the kids use them to set fires  or use them as a battering ram.<br />
      <br />
      There is actually a second path  by the side of the   steam which comes out by the park but is un passable  at the moment due   to rubbish. It seams as though this could be an ideal  project for <a href="http://www.cheshireprobation.org.uk/OurRoles/comm_payback.php">Community Payback</a> With this local criminal work for the community clearing paths etc. We    have asked Cllrs Brian Silvester and Andrew Knowles if this walk can be    made safe and usable this summer.<br />
      <br />
      The other problem as you can  see in the photo above is   rubbish, a few weeks ago in our clean Crewe  campaign we reported   rubbish in the area which was removed by the  council but since then   someone has emptied half a house into the stream  and the whole stream   needs the trolleys and rubbish removing. <br />
