<p><strong>ii. Footpaths</strong><br />
  Approval for funding of £500K has been  confirmed last week to undertake footpath reinstatement/construction  works.  The group welcomed this news with  enthusiasm and Howard Curran requested a thank you letter be sent on behalf of  the Friends to the Leader of the Council.  </p>
<p>Plans are presently being submitted and are to be liaised upon with the  DRE.  </p>
<p>Charlie Griffies presented a map of the Park and detailed the work to be  undertaken in line with DVA requirements.   Derek Morgan observed that the group is proud to have obtained this  additional funding which is down to all the lobbying done by all present, and  support from Chief Officers.</p>
<ul>
  <li> He noted that work in the valley (Coronation  Walk) is not included in this plan – that part of the project is dependent on  any spare monies from the footpaths, plus possible funding from WREN.</li>
</ul>
<p> A  question about a possible Poppy Bank against Victoria Avenue was raised – it  was agreed that this commemorative tribute should be actioned for 2016 to  coincide with the Centenary of Flanders.  </p>
<ul>
  <li> It was also pleasing to note that the Gulf War  Memorial has been refurbished, replacement plaque made and memorial cleaned and  reinstated.</li>
</ul>

  <strong>Friends of Queens Park  Web Site</strong><br />
  Peter Sinclair was welcomed:  before early retirement, he looked after the  council&rsquo;s web pages.  Peter shared with  us advice regarding the creation of a dedicated QP web site. He was able to  offer suggestions and useful guidance to Kirsty and Sheila who hope to implement  a site very soon.  In the meantime,  Kirsty has investigated available domain names. </p>
<p>He had recently  created a simple web site which would be useful for the Friends to view re  format etc.<br />

    <p><strong>5.4  CCTV</strong><br />
      Elaine  Dodd has liaised with English Heritage and CEC Conservation Officer, who both have  posed no objection to the columns and their locations.  She has completed a Planning application which  was despatched a fortnight ago with advice received from the CCTV Controller&rsquo;s  team.  Approval time is anticipated 12-15  weeks.  In the meantime preparation works  can continue re BT licences, ducting and cabling works, external equipment  housing. The purchase of equipment is around £25K in total for 2 fully functional black 'predator' cameras  (360 Vision Technology) that will pan 360 degrees and tilt of 180 degrees.</p>
    <p><strong>5.5  Lakeside Pavilion</strong> <br />
      Elaine  is working closely with the <em>Pickle Jar</em> to assist in marketing the facilities.  Ideas  to date include:</p>
    <p>A <strong>Wedding Information Pack</strong> – She has  prepared some draft designs to keep costs down for them, including the idea of Inserts  make the pack flexible.</p>
    <p>Plus  an idea, to introduce a <strong>PRINCE and  PRINCESSES Club</strong>.  A modest membership  fee would apply; when joining, each child would receive a membership card and  gift.  Prior to their birthday each year,  they would receive notification about children&rsquo;s parties in the pavilion,  encouraging parents to have &ldquo;the mess here and not at home&rdquo;, then a birthday  card with offer of a free ice cream or similar. It is envisaged that the child  would bring along friends and guardians so the scheme would also generate some  purchases .  Collection of addresses and  emails is an issue as someone needs to keep on top of applications and dispatch  information.  Resultant data could also  be utilised on a database for other forms of &lsquo;relationship marketing&rsquo;.</p>
    <div>
      <p><strong>5.6  Boating on the Lake</strong> – plans are underway to  re-introduce this.  A contractor has  looked at the area and is developing plans for a landing stage, together with  tidying of perimeter.  Works to fencing,  steps etc will be separate.  The Pickle  Jar&rsquo;s bank are ascertaining details about how other areas operate and this will  assist with Risk Assessments and Insurance issues.  </p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>5.7  Memorial Benches</strong></p>
    <div><br />
      Three new benches have been purchased by families, including  one for Lindsay Capper one of the Park Wardens who sadly passed away.  Elaine Dodd is to escort Lindsay&rsquo;s mother to view  the bench located next to the bowling green.   Hopefully, her photograph and a press story will create more  enquires.  A summary information sheet is  available and the Cemetery are kindly adding this insert into their bereavement  packs. </div>
    <p>5.8  There is some external funding support from  Highways for <strong>Cycle Racks</strong> to  complement the adjacent cycleway.  Some  improvement works to the entry to the cycleway at TipKinder is also planned of  installation in March.</p>
    <p><strong>5.9  Burma Star Island</strong><br />
      A  sponsorship package has been sent out to &lsquo;The Round Table&rsquo; for their kind  consideration, following a meeting last year with the ANTs and Elaine .  The Round Table  held a meeting last week so we await their  support concerning this project with interest.   The Friends have already committed funding raising toward this project and  residual monies will have to be made up from either existing Ground Maintence  Budgets or a grant application to WREN, or a mixture of the two.  Plans are also be revisited and updated and  will be presented at the next meeting. <br />
      It  was stressed that the Friends have not specified an exact amount to be used  from their funds but will commit an agreed sum as previously voted to support  this scheme.  An estimated project figure  of £12-15K has been calculated, this is to be discussed at a future meeting.  </p>
    <p><strong>5.10  The CEC Queens Park Website</strong> Elaine Dodd has recently been  updated re Works in Progress, Benches,  Angling and Events Calendar.  </p>
    <p><strong>Friends of Queens Park Website</strong>: Sheila Blackburn (Secretary)  has suggested that the group has its own web site.  Secretary is to write to a web-site designer,  known to CEC, to invite him to discuss issues at the next Friends meeting in  March.  Kristy Taylor, ANT&rsquo;s, is also  very knowledge in this regard and specialises at work in IT so is able to  assist. </p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>6          Events Diary to date</strong><br />
      Last  year we probably saw more community type events here than in the previous 20 years.  The draft programme to-date is available and  is to be posted on notice boards in the Park.   The UK  triathlon, Orienteering Society and Education are yet to confirm any dates and  requirements.  We only at the end of  January and already usage is already looking good.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>7          Queen&rsquo;s Park Angling Review</strong><br />
      Permit  visuals were made available for attendees to see – the artwork is very  profession and thanks were made to the Elaine Dodd.  All indications are that the Angling  Initiative has been very  successful to  date and many appreciative comments have been received from users and local  Clubs.<br />
      Ian  Henry reported that there are 27 temporary, trial pegs set out so far and plans  to create 3 disabled pegs with access. One of the pegs has already been  identified to be re-sited. Membership has been set at £5 per year or £3 for a  day ticket. There are no fees for under 16s. There is already a membership of  70.<br />
      The  group wants to promote active and responsible youth involvement  through negotiations for a coaching day with  Stapeley Angling and through liaison with the Police. Hopefully, the group will  be able to set up a member data base in the future.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>8          ANTs Review</strong><br />
      8.1  Chris Curran presented  a report, beginning with the latest day of action happening the day before the  meeting, when 21 volunteers braved the weather to work outside, tidying  specific areas, whilst others worked inside to refurbish benches and clean  windows.<br />
      The ANTs have plans for the Community Garden  to the rear of the East Lodge: they are to initiate a design competition in a  local Primary School, inviting garden designs from pupils in 13 classes. The  overall winner will receive an award and the winning design is to be presented  to garden planners at (eg) Reaseheath   College so that the  design can be realised and pupils can be involved in the very first &ldquo;digging&rdquo;.  It was also agreed that prizes for winners from each class should be provided. <br />
      This project is seen as a valuable way to involve children  in the voluntary workforce and to encourage responsible use of the Park.</p>
    <p>8.2  The ANTs are also  hoping to establish a group of volunteers who can come to work in the Park  outside the recognised Action Days. This is based on a scheme at Birkenhead Park that now has a regular force of 80  volunteers, especially retired people who would like to be involved. The ANTs  are looking to establish this activity with a signing in  scheme and small tool storage.</p>
    <p>8.3  The 23rd  February is the next ANTs Day of Action   when volunteers will be joined by members of Slimming World as part of  their Body Magic Programme.</p>
    <p><strong>9          AOB</strong><br />
      <strong>9.1  Dogs in the Park</strong>: Joanne Clewes gave a detailed  account of how she was walking her dog on a lead in the Park recently and was  set upon by a large dog that was not under control. The owner of the dog is  known to the group. The police and Elaine Dodd were informed and visited.  The Dog Wardens and PCSOs are to talk to the  owner about maintaining a dog under control in the Park.<br />
      During  detailed discussion, it was pointed out that the &lsquo;Dog Control Order&rsquo; is being  revisited and is to be updated, however, the Council is looking for a wide  order to cover several parks and this could take some time. It was agreed that  the Secretary should write to George Broughton asking for the matter to be  given more urgent consideration in view of recent dog-related incidents.</p>
    <p><strong>9.2  Structure Changes</strong>: Derek Morgan introduced initial  proposals for the new Parks structure and expressed his concerns, especially in  view of the loss of Park Wardens. It is uncertain what will happen to the role  of Park Manager. The group  would be most  concerned if her support was diluted further in any way and Derek assured the  meeting that he would not hesitate to write to relevant personnel if there are  any developments. Howard Curran pointed out the CE are losing staff and that it  is hard to do anything until possible outcomes are known. It was stressed  again, that the post of Park Manager should not be diluted in any way.</p>
    <p><strong>9.3  Improvements</strong><br />
      Thanks  were passed on for the new, privately purchased<strong> bench</strong>, sited close to the west gate and bandstand – this is much  appreciated by daily dog walkers and visitors to the Park.</p>
    <p>9.4  It was also confirmed that two new <strong>notice boards</strong> are to be installed this  week along the main drive and by the Tipkinder entrance. The board formerly at  the front gate is to be relocated at the south gate (Moreton Road).</p>
    <p>9.5  In response to a question about the <strong>old depot</strong> and any developments about  its demolition and use of the land, Charlie Griffies replied that there is no  further information. He was also able to confirm funding procedures for the <strong>footpaths</strong>. Howard Curran asked about  the <strong>steps</strong> from the Burma Star Island  bridge to the south gate and was assured that improved access through gentler  gradients is part of the footpath plans.</p>
    <p><strong>9.6  Power Boats on the lake</strong>: in response to concerns about  the use of large, remote controlled boats on the lake, Elaine Dodd agreed to  request guidance from George Broughton. There was a lot of discussion about the  impact on wildlife and any contamination and it was suggested that incidents  are logged for future reference.<br />

      4.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Review<br />
      As we enter into the Winter period, our Chairperson reviewed the   			year in Queens Park.<br />
      He reported that 2013 has seen visitor numbers treble with support   			also from the local<br />
      community. Thanks were given to all those involved. An eventing   			summary of partners is<br />
      attached.<br />
      In summary:<br />
      Primary Schools – 300 visiting pupils from Pebble Brook Primary,   			Edleston Primary,<br />
      Beechwood Primary and Gainsborough Primary &amp; Nursery enjoyed arts   			and crafts, play,<br />
      CCTV unit, learning tours and fun - including artwork for an   			anti-litter campaign. Their<br />
      posters are now installed onto new bins along the main driveway.   			(Ben Wye was asked to<br />
      say a little more about this and about another day he has planned   			under any other<br />
      business. )<br />
      University<br />
      Manchester Metropolitan University utilised the Park in partnership   			to launch their &lsquo;Arts in<br />
      Focus&rsquo; events. Display boards were erected in the Lakeside Pavilion   			and arrangements<br />
      made by the Park to invite all key partners and press to attend.<br />
      Sports Clubs - the UK Orienteering Club have mapped an orienteering   			course and<br />
      undertaken a trial event. It is hoped to introduce this formal   			course during the Summer of<br />
      2014, making it a flexible route so that it can accommodate details   			of heritage, trees,<br />
      planting and wildlife.<br />

      Friends events included Clay making workshops and support for Play   			Day.<br />
      There have been Open Doors by the Wardens and PCSO's; charity fund   			raising events for<br />
      Cancer, Scouts and also Stroke UK; sporting groups such as the UK   			Harriers, the UK<br />
      Triathlon group and Leisure Services Sports Development, plus a   			great deal of casual<br />
      involvement.<br />
      WORK FORCES<br />
      The community were challenged by the Leader of the Council in   			August, to demonstrate<br />
      their support of the park following a spurt of vandalism and   			negative press. The response<br />
      has been phenomenal.<br />
      South Cheshire College – maintenance days and painting of historical   			tree memorial<br />
      plaques. There is more help to come from them too – thank you to our   			Treasurer for<br />
      establishing this link.<br />
      Kings Grove Students with their painting of benches along the main   			driveway again has<br />
      made an impact and improvement.<br />
      The largest external help has been from the newly established   			committee group called<br />
      ANTs, Action Not Talk. Almost 100 volunteers turned up to support   			their first weekend of<br />
      maintenance works, with around the same number for their second   			weekend of action.<br />
      The ANTs are supported by Officers of the Parks team and the Friends   			group, who both<br />
      cannot thank them enough. The impact of such a large number of   			hands-on support is<br />
      significantly noticeable.<br />
      The ANTs are also busy trying to establish interest for external   			project sponsorship, such<br />
      as the refurbishment of the Burma Star Island; the Friends are   			holding funds to support<br />
      these works as previously agreed. External organisations are being   			more responsive to a<br />
      community based request.<br />
      CEC have continued with on-going maintenance works, including a back   			log of debris<br />
      cleared from the sluice inlet by the Maintenance team, following   			last year&rsquo;s floods and<br />
      debris coming into the inlet. Some additional dredging took place in   			a Health &amp; Safety<br />
      high risk area. Works were done in liaison with the Environment   			Agency. It is planned to<br />
      clear the inlet weekly, opening the gates regularly to prevent a   			further build-up.<br />
      THE LAKESIDE PAVILION<br />
      CEC have aimed to assist the Pickle Jar&rsquo;s business in its infancy,   			with regards to rent and<br />
      the introduction of improvements to the Pavilion. An excellent   			relationship exists with<br />
      Park management and the &lsquo;Pickle Jar&rsquo; has supported a number of   			events and<br />
      programmes, with resources and sponsorships, to mutual advantage.<br />
      The Parks Manager as Licensee: this has been transferred to the   			Pickle Jar with a view to<br />
      expand eventing potential.<br />
      Arrangements with a partner third party has enabled a mini crazy   			golf to be introduced, at<br />
      no cost to CEC or The Pickle Jar; this is on an income share basis.<br />
      An exciting new development follows a recent inspection by the   			Cheshire Registrar. An<br />
      application is underway to establish the Queens Park Lakeside   			Pavilion as an Approved<br />
      Wedding Venue. This will include the Pavilion, the Veranda and the   			Ornate Bandstand,<br />
      with the West Lodge as a contingency facility.<br />
      Friends of Queens Park Minutes: October 7 th 2013 page 3<br />
      The permit will last for three years.<br />
      In preparation for this added attraction, a Wedding Fayre was staged   			earlier in the<br />
      season.<br />
      SECURITY PARTNERS<br />
      A Security Group has been launched – consisting of Police, PCSO&rsquo;s   			Fires Services,<br />
      Assets, Wardens, QP Manager, Cafe Contractor and Friends.<br />
      Focused activity by CEC Wardens has involved an &lsquo;Open Door&rsquo; month   			long event to<br />
      promote confidence in the Park.<br />
      High profile walkabouts continued in September along with local   			PSCO&rsquo;s.<br />
      Fishing Patrols continue to deter inexperienced anglers until a QP   			Anglers Club is<br />
      created... club details are in progress – see below.<br />
      CCTV funding has been made available to combat vandalism and deter   			ASB. Four<br />
      internal cameras have been installed inside the Lakeside Pavilion,   			with screen and<br />
      monitoring equipment. Two external mosquitoes have also been   			installed for out-of-<br />
      hours entry into the Park.<br />
      Arrangements are underway for the provision of 2 cameras for the   			Games Pavilion.<br />
      An internal major investment of some £30K has been confirmed for the   			installation of 2 x<br />
      columns to view most of the parkland. The system is to be linked   			into the town&rsquo;s Central<br />
      Control Room for monitoring and recording.<br />
      All works are subject to the Heritage Listed Building Consent –   			arrangements underway.<br />
      Connected to the above: more good news. The Park has been upgraded   			to an English<br />
      Heritage listing 2*+ - thanks to Elaine Dodd for the work done in   			achieving the upgrading<br />
      and recognition.<br />
      SOCIAL MEDIA<br />
      Confidence in Queens Park is growing and despite the inevitable   			mixed postings<br />
      associated with open media, the positives are now outweighing the   			negatives. This month<br />
      has seen that 956 people have liked the Queens Park page, with 30   			people sharing and<br />
      commenting on messages, with a massive 1061 &lsquo;hits&rsquo;.<br />
      A number of letters and compliments have been received regarding the   			main drive and<br />
      the quality of planting and the display achieved.<br />
      USER QUESTIONNAIRE<br />
      A User Questionnaire has been introduced and used at one of the   			events to promote<br />
      feedback. Results are being collated by Derek Morgan, Chair of The   			Friends.<br />
      Early indications are that the vast majority consider facilities to   			be clean and tidy. Most<br />
      visitors are from the local attachment and expressed a desire to   			have the pathways and<br />
      Coronation Walk completed. Other requests are for more entertainment   			and the return of<br />

      MOVING FORWARD<br />
      ASSETS<br />
      Cheshire East Council have an Assets Division who play a key role in   			moving forward in<br />
      partnership with the Parks Management. Monthly meetings are   			undertaken plus support<br />
      on an on-going basis as maintenance matters arise.<br />
      This includes the Parks cyclical maintenance and on-going   			maintenance items costing<br />
      around £50,000 pa.<br />
      Assets have also dealt with much red tape and project untangling re   			end of contract and<br />
      snagging items so that they are able to move forward to any next   			phase.<br />
      THE HERITAGE LOTTERY FUND<br />
      The Council met with the Lottery last week to agree to the   			Management Maintenance<br />
      Programme confirming details of the on-going commitment by Cheshire   			East Council to<br />
      the Park. The Council has expressed a desire for future support from   			the HLF and any<br />
      other funding sources for a phase 2 application to be able to   			complete works.<br />
      During the course of this meeting Cheshire East Council agreed to   			push forward the<br />
      pathway works and to make a Spring 2014 start, from an application   			of funding from the<br />
      capital expenditure, this will go forward after 1 st April. The HLF   			are delighted and have<br />
      agreed to release the withheld funds as a gesture of goodwill now   			this commitment has<br />
      been made.<br />
      Thanks were made to all in The Friends, our Councillors and Members   			for their continued<br />
      lobbying and the ANTs for giving this a hard final push to get this   			commitment.<br />
      5. C&amp;N LIONS EVENTS<br />
      The Chair presented a summary and reported a loss of £4000 on the   			recent event (August<br />
      2013) and a loss of £7000 in the past few years. It was noted that   			the tribute act event<br />
      will not be repeated.<br />
      C&amp;N lions kindly donated all profits from the sale of glow products   			at the event to the<br />
      Friends with thanks for their work on the day.<br />
      The Lantern Procession will be the final event of the year on 8 th   			December.<br />
      Arrangements are similar to last year: Christmas Craft workshop for   			children in the<br />
      Lakeside pavilion, followed by the Parade from the main gate and a   			presentation in the<br />
      Lakeside Pavilion by the Pickle Jar team.<br />
      6. ANGLING<br />
      Several meeting have taken place with Angling Clubs. As a result, an   			independent QP<br />
      Angling Club is to be established by January 2014.<br />
      The group will be affiliated into the Friends Constitution –   			likewise the ANTs.<br />
      Activities&rsquo; will include Youth sessions and initiatives to care and   			improve the waters and<br />
      wildlife/fowl.<br />
      Ian Henry outlined developments and answered questions. He spoke of   			a dedicated club<br />
      for half of the lake and 27 pegs. There is to be an annual fee of £5   			for all over 16 with no<br />
      concessions. A £3 day ticket will be available for occasional   			anglers.<br />
      Fishing will be monitored by Ian and a team of volunteers and closed   			season regulations<br />
      will be observed.<br />
      Friends of Queens Park Minutes: October 7 th 2013 page 5<br />
      Ian answered questions and reassured the meeting about limiting   			damage to the lake<br />
      banks and vehicle access.<br />
      It is proposed that the Club&rsquo;s HQ will be the West Lodge and the   			Park Manager (Elaine<br />
      Dodd) confirmed that she is looking into insurance to cover all   			groups: the Friends, Ants<br />
      and Anglers.<br />
      7. ANTS<br />
      Chris Curran reported on two highly successful weekends of action in   			the Park with<br />
      volunteers clocking up 800 hours of work. It was stressed that the   			group was set up in a<br />
      bid to release monies from CEC and that benefits to the appearance   			of the Park are<br />
      regarded as a bonus.<br />
      The next day of action is to be October 26 th. The group intends to   			work on through the<br />
      coming winter and to make future arrangements for volunteers to work   			on an ad hoc basis<br />
      throughout the week, rather than waiting for designated days of   			action. Members also<br />
      intend to visit Birkenhead Park to find out how their strong   			volunteer group is organised<br />
      and run.<br />
      8. Any Other Business<br />
      Ben Wye (see above) gave details of a further schools event to be   			held on October 15 th<br />
      from 1-3pm. Four local Primary Schools (as before) will bring their   			10 year old pupils to<br />
      the Park for Autumn activities, including bird feeders, flower beds,   			willow weaving and tree<br />
      identification.<br />
      Joan Dickinson reminded the meeting that bird boxes made by students   			from South<br />
      Cheshire College still need to be put up – the Ants group will   			consider including this in<br />
      their next day of action.<br />
      Derek Morgan (Chair) asked that the minutes record that the ANTs   			group is working<br />
      to complement and not replace the work of CEC in the Park.<br />
      Thanks were to Mike and Karen for their hospitality here tonight.<br />
      Questions and Answers<br />
      Coronation Walk:<br />
      A new stream base, surface and pump is needed which requires   			considerable investment.<br />
      The next commitment is to the park paths (see above).<br />
      Park Lighting – night events.<br />
      This is still a concern and is on the park action list.<br />
      AGM<br />
      The next meeting will be the AGM and has been changed to Monday   			December 9 th at<br />
      6pm in The Lakeside Pavilion.<br />

      1.0 Apologies noted<br />
  <br />
      2.0 Previous Minutes<br />
      3.0 Matters arising - None raised<br />
  <br />
      4.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Project Update<br />
      The situation regarding works and the HLF bid remains as per the   			last meeting in that we have received assurances from senior   			directors re their commitment. As explained at December meeting,   			Derek, met Peter Hartwell and Elaine, and was reassured by what was   			discussed. They have met with the Heritage Lottery regarding the   			next bid to complete the Park as much as possible. <br />
      A company called Gillespies has been called in to assist with this   			process, and the work on the application already undertaken by   			George and Elaine. Gillepsies are still helping to claim the final   			£0.5 mill payment from the Heritage.<br />
      In the interim the Management Maintenance Plan is almost complete   			and awaiting approval, firstly by Assets who will be responsible for   			the majority of ongoing maintenance and then by Members to ensure we   			get enough budget to maintain the Park as necessary. The Heritage   			will have their say regarding its content and CEC&rsquo;s future   			commitment.<br />
      In addition, Mr Hartwell was working to confirm some additional   			funding to commence some of the footpath works; whilst we await his   			confirmation regarding this, it does look quite positive. <br />
      Chris Lawton has re-measured the pathways and received some budget   			costings – the value to complete works is around £500K, which is a   			big improvement on the £2mill figure quoted elsewhere!<br />
      This works includes full excavation, capable of supporting the   			weight of a standard lorry, ground prep, foundation and topping,   			also for granite edgings, which the lottery are insisting on. They   			exclude edgings to East / West pathway completed in 2011 and also   			Coronation Valley as this will be a complete project once design and   			funding have been agreed. Elaine has passed these figures to Peter   			and remains hopeful of a favourable response. Failing this works   			will be part of the next HLF bid.<br />
      The Community Wardens These are now in-situ in the Park, and also   			have responsibility for some cover on other Warden duties such as   			car parking. Hopefully they will be full time again on their normal   			duties in the Summer peak periods.<br />
  <br />
      Recent vandalism - <br />
      On the Play Ground the new hand-made xylophone, which was replaced   			and fitted twice – our own staff actually making the second   			replacement!!, has once again been ripped off – in fact it only   			lasted days. Clearly there is no point in replacing another unit.   			Costs are being obtained to replace it with something else. <br />
  <br />
      Matting under the swings is to be re-laid and prices obtained to   			replace both with matting. It has sunk-in due to wet conditions   			obviously but it does get lots of use. <br />
      Lots of lake slabs have been ripped up and thrown into lake.<br />
      Store doors to cafe veranda have been ripped off again.<br />
      Bins have been thrown into the lake – it&rsquo;s tiring when people post   			about litter in social media, when they could assist to tackle the   			issue. A problem of approaching individuals re peer pressure is one   			of likely verbal abuse.<br />
      Friends Group Posts:<br />
      Elaine has been acting as temporary Treasurer. Joan Dickinson put up   			for the position and was voted to the post. Joan was welcomed with   			our thanks. <br />
  <br />
      Grant / Fund Raising Officer – As mentioned at the last meeting, a   			potential member has been approached for this post - he has been   			Invited to discuss this further and confirm his kind interest shown.<br />

      6.0 Orienteering<br />
      Jane Mockford gave a very comprehensive presentation about   			Orienteering. She explained the background, who and how it&rsquo;s   			organised, events and who can take part. Of particular interest is   			the part that our Park can play and how it can be developed as an   			orienteering course with differentiated activities. Jane&rsquo;s proposals   			and forthcoming events will be good for Park publicity as well as   			for encouraging new orienteering members. Interest shown by schools   			also links it to 7.0 below. This is a very exciting development and   			Jane was thanked for her time and efforts..<br />
      7.0 QP as an Education Facility<br />
      Ben Wye, coordinated a school day supported by Elaine, Sheila and   			Jan. This involved a Science day with PGCE students from MMU who   			worked with children from Wistaston Green Primary School on   			specially designed projects. It went extremely well and there has   			been lots of interest and feedback. We look forward with great   			interest to see how this progresses. The day followed on from last   			year&rsquo;s work on developing Crewe Park as an educational resource. We   			also hope to build up projects and resources for other schools to   			use, such as the Maths Trail, devised last year with pupils from   			Gainsborough Primary School. Edleston and Pebble Brook will   			hopefully be involved in this. <br />
      Joan Dickinson reported that students from S Cheshire College have   			made bird boxes that need locating and fixing around the Park. The   			15th February at 10am was suggested for the students to visit the   			Park for this project.<br />
  <br />
      8.0 Furniture Workshop<br />
  <br />
      A group is needed to catalogue Park furniture, map where it is   			situated and to devise a selection of preferred choices of new items   			from a list of options. Concerns about dedicated seating were   			addressed and there was discussion about commemorative plates being   			displayed in the Park (Sensory Garden or Lodge) when the seats are   			no longer viable. Elaine advised that in future, all new benches   			will have to be maintained by owners or those who buy them as   			memorials. Some examples of potential new furniture were displayed.   			Elaine and Derek hope to begin this on February 14th and 15th from   			10am and welcome helpers.<br />
      Any other Business<br />
      Questions were raised about hold ups in the ongoing renovations and   			there was much discussion about cut backs and the maintenance plan.<br />
      The refurbishment of Burma Star Island was also debated, together   			with the Sensory Garden which was previously moved to Stapeley. It   			was suggested that the latter be re-instated close to the Pavilion.   			After much discussion, a vote was taken re: Elaine requested to look   			at the pros and cons of the Friends Group fund-raising for a one-off   			project specifically for help towards the refurbishment of Burma   			Star Island. The vote was 7/4 in favour and was accepted.<br />
      Dogs on Leads: this was debated in relation to school groups – and   			all users – in the Park and it was remarked that there is existing   			signage to rule that dogs should be on a lead. Elaine to raise   			matter with the Dog Wardens<br />

      Noted <br />
  <br />
      2.0 Previous Minutes Agreed as read<br />
  <br />
      3.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Report &amp; Summary (read by Elaine Dodd as Derek   			Morgan delayed in traffic)<br />
  <br />
      3.1 Derek Morgan met with Peter Hartwell recently, Peter is one of   			CEC&rsquo;s directors. The meeting was called following the request for an   			update regarding the current situation in the Park. Derek was   			pleased to note CEC&rsquo;s commitment towards the project....... and   			assured the meeting that there is a lot of work and support going on   			in the background.<br />
      The Directors have met with the Heritage Lottery regarding the next   			bid to complete the Park as much as possible. A company called   			Gillespies has been called in to assist with this process, and the   			work on the application already undertaken by George and Elaine.   			Gillepsies are also tying up the loose ends to help claim the final   			£0.5 mill payment from the Heritage.<br />
      In the interim the Management Maintenance Plan is almost complete   			and awaiting approval, firstly by Assets who will be responsible for   			the majority of ongoing maintenance and then by Members to ensure we   			get enough budget to maintain the Park as necessary. The Heritage   			will have their say regarding its content and CEC&rsquo;s future   			commitment.<br />
      In addition, Mr Hartwell was working to confirm some additional   			funding to commence some of the footpath works; whilst we await his   			confirmation regarding this, it does look quite positive.<br />
      The Community Wardens are now in situation in the East Lodge – their   			presence is assisting with informal supervision in the Park. IT   			connections have been installed to help them in their work and also   			to encourage use of the room by Police PCSO&rsquo;s. We have regular   			Security meetings with all policing and fire partners plus other   			agencies, their assistance in tackling much of the ASB has been most   			productive, working alongside Elaine. However, it is sad to report   			damage to 14 trees, those newly planted on the main drive, looks   			like mindless vandalism - a sharp knife has probably been used to   			damage tree bark. Whilst it looks as though most trees will survive,   			they will be scarred for their &lsquo;life&rsquo; and will not look as beautiful   			as they should. As the tree lined driveway is one of the historical   			features reintroduced in the Park, this is very sad news.<br />
  <br />
      3.2 Vacant posts... Nominations were invited for: <br />
      Treasurer – Elaine has been nominated temporarily until the   			positioned can be filled by a Friend.<br />
      Grant / Fund Raising Officer – A Member had expressed an interest   			and is to be invited to discuss further and confirm the kind   			interest shown.<br />
      3.3 Ben Wye, whose valuable schools liaison work was noted, has   			supplied the following information:<br />
      Following on from last year&rsquo;s work on developing Crewe Park as an   			educational resource, MMU are hoping that their PGCE primary   			students will be able to undertake a special short project in the   			New Year. This will involve students meeting in the park for an   			introductory visit and talk, preferably with park staff/friends   			(Elaine and Linda) to lead. Sheila and Jan requested to be involved   			also.<br />
      The intro session will be on Monday 28th January pm (1-3 approx), to   			be followed by students working with a class of children from one of   			the local schools on Wednesday 30th January, morning or afternoon -   			(perhaps half a group in each session). The students will have   			devised age-appropriate science based activities to work on with the   			children in the park. This would then have the possibility of being   			followed up in the school on Monday afternoon 4th February.   			Hopefully, that students will produce a scheme of work (of which   			they will have delivered a small part), and make contributions to   			the Crewe Park website. Edleston, Wistaston Green and Pebble Brook   			are interested in being part of this. <br />
      Those present agreed that this is really fantastic news thanked Ben   			for his commitment.<br />
      3.4 One of our new members, Joan Dickenson, has also presented some   			interesting proposals regarding potential input from students at   			South Cheshire College. The group will be kept informed how this   			progresses and thanked Joan for her efforts to help the project.<br />

  <br />
      No Item<br />
      Pre AGM Item - George Broughton, Parks Dev Officer – was introduced   			and asked to give a brief update re the HLF situation:<br />
  <br />
      The HLF are not able to consider a new application until the MMP and   			some legalities have been signed off and agreed with regards to for   			the last bid which is in its final stages. The MMP guides the way   			forward for the next 10 years ensuring there are suitable resources   			for the Park over this period. The document will be consulted on   			once it has been accepted by the HLF, so there still remains time   			for interested parties to make comments and contribute towards the   			final maintence plan.<br />
  <br />
      However, the HLF have visited the Park and are very supportive so   			far, as is our current HLF Monitoring Officer. <br />
  <br />
      The prelim application for the next bid has already gone in. The   			more detailed bid is due by February 2013. They are altering their   			bidding process and we will shortly receive details regarding this. <br />
  <br />
      Two of our senior Directors visited the HLF in Manchester yesterday   			and we wait to discover what has been agreed to push things forward.   			Information will be shared once received.<br />
  <br />
      CEC also need to confirm their support for the contribution towards   			the project, this will be a member decision. We are looking for a   			total of £1.5mill. to finalize the project<br />
  <br />
      An initial approach has been made to &lsquo;Gillespies&rsquo; consultants to   			assist with the final bid application. They are experienced in this,   			as it is most important we satisfy all of the HLF guidelines their   			input would be invaluable. <br />
  <br />
      Q – What is the focus of the bid?<br />
      All aspects which will maximise visitors and footfall, issues re the   			management of the grounds and facilities, events, all helping to   			make QP a centre for community activities., encourage visitors and   			participation. Primarily - pathways, Coronation Valley and Walkway –   			a most exciting project. Lake aeration, including the planting and   			landing stage, a community garden at the E Lodge, Burma Star Island   			and memorial upgrade, electric ring, plus the other memorials, a   			sensory garden has been proposed, street furniture...... <br />
  <br />
      Q – How will the Ringway Jacobs proposal effect QP?<br />
      This is a proposed new way for service delivery. RJ&rsquo;s already   			undertake the highway works and proposals are for them to take over   			most of the Pyms Lane functions, excluding cemeteries, crematorium   			and toilet cleaning. The decisions was accepted by Cabinet, however,   			&lsquo;called-in&rsquo; due to questions raised by partners and so is under   			scrutiny. The implications for QP are as yet unknown.<br />
  <br />
      As a side issue the proposed Crewe Town Council was discussed. It   			was thought that this would not come into fruition within the next   			12 months at least.<br />
  <br />
      1 AGM Commenced – Apologies<br />
      Welcome to the second Friends Group AGM by Derek Morgan<br />
  <br />
  <br />
      1. Chairperson&rsquo;s Report<br />
      Derek Morgan presented his report for the year.<br />
  <br />
      2. Thank you all formally for attending and supporting the Park as   			the Park draws closer to refurbishment, whilst not complete great   			strives have been made and despite some annoyances for certain   			things not done we have a beautiful facility and one still to be   			proud of.<br />
  <br />
      3. Highlights of the year have included the many community and   			school events which have taken place. I thank all those involved in   			making those events happen how great to see so many young people   			enjoying our Park.<br />
  <br />
      4. It is only by getting the youths involved that they will value   			the Park and hopefully even become ambassadors and help us to look   			after the facility, providing also all important peer pressure.<br />
  <br />
      5. Appreciation to the various Security services and our own Wardens   			for helping to tackle the anti-social behaviour which was getting   			out of hand following the demise of our last Park Warden. All of the   			joint efforts have proved fruitful and whilst a dedicated presence   			would be all of our&rsquo;s preference, the joint partnership has been   			seen to make a difference. Thank you again to all involved. <br />
  <br />
      6. The Parks Manager role has been a difficult one, with reduced or   			non existent budgets, satisfying all interest parties and we enter   			into yet another period of instability.<br />
  <br />
      7. Looking to the year ahead, there will be a lot going on – and I   			would ask you to confirm on the volunteers list if your are able to   			help with small works, events, PR....., especially (probably   			Sundays) looking forward into next year.<br />
  <br />
      3 8. Election of Officers<br />
      9. The Chair listed the &lsquo;Core&rsquo; Committee Members as:<br />
      Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer <br />
  <br />
      – the Treasure role is subject to a vacancy – No-one at the AGM was   			interested, so the vacancy would be convey to Members at the next   			Friends Meeting.<br />
  <br />
      10. Two years ago, it was voted to Core elect Officers for a 3 year   			term This has assisted with planning, plus getting ourselves into   			this new role and banking requirements like authorised signatures   			for cheques, charity status bank account and so on.<br />
      It does not distract from the option to terminate Officers if you do   			not think the Members are performing. <br />
  <br />
      Clause 6e states where a vote of &lsquo;no confidence&rsquo; can be brought   			against a member of the committee, if approved by 2/3rd of those   			attending, that member will be removed from office. <br />
  <br />
      11. Due to personal circumstances the Fund Raising Officer had not   			been able to be effective this year; it was Proposed this position   			be cancelled from the Committee. Seconded by Howard Curran. Accepted   			unanimously. .<br />
  <br />
      It was further proposed a role be considered as Grant / Fund Raising   			Officer, as there are monies available to community groups which can   			be applied for. Elaine (QPM) is willing to assist with the   			applications should any member be interested in taking up this role.<br />
  <br />
      Proposed the role of Events &amp; Fund Raising Officer be accepted.   			Seconded by <br />
      Jan Wright. Accepted unanimously. No-one at the AGM was interested,   			so the vacancy would be convey to Members at the next Friends   			Meeting<br />

      Sheila Blackburn presented her report for the year.<br />
  <br />
      16. Over the year, my role as Secretary has again been divided into   			2 parts: Secretarial work and events and activities in the Park.<br />
  <br />
      17. Secretarial duties have included:<br />
      Minutes taken and circulated for each of our group meetings and I am   			grateful to Elaine for her continued help in this – also in the   			circulation of agendas etc.<br />
  <br />
      18. Correspondence<br />

  <br />
      19. Notice boards<br />
      Thanks to information and posters from various sources, the Notice   			Boards have been updated regularly throughout the year and we look   			forward to the installation of new boards at the south and west   			gates to further publicise Park events and news.<br />
  <br />
      20. Misc:<br />
      Stationery items (notelets, cards, postcards) have not been   			developed as I would have liked, but I have made and used thank you   			cards bearing the Friends logo.<br />
      Park brochures are something I would still like to develop together   			with Howard&rsquo;s guide to the Park.<br />
      The Installation of a computer in the West Lodge for use by   			Secretary and Friends Group is still on my wish list!<br />
  <br />
      21. Events<br />
      Cutbacks and lack of funds delayed this year&rsquo;s Summer events   			programme, but the Friends have supported various activities:<br />
      Christmas Lantern Parade<br />
      Queen&rsquo;s Jubilee Event in the Park<br />
      Crewe &amp; Nantwich Lions Voice Search<br />
      and I would like to thank those who gave their time to help,   			especially Lisa and Daniel Prime and <br />
      Roy Prince.<br />
  <br />
      22. My clay workshop was a great success -- on the Pavilion veranda   			this year! Thank you to Mo Grant and Derek Morgan for coming to   			support me on the first very hectic Sunday afternoon. Several   			parents asked about further sessions and I did suggest a Christmas   			clay craft workshop, but this is still to be arranged.<br />
  <br />
      23. In addition to the work done by Ben Wye to support schools using   			the Park, I was pleased to organise a Maths Trail with Y5 pupils   			from Gainsborough Primary School, back in January. The boys had a   			great afternoon, setting questions and taking photos and have since   			published a booklet for other children to use – my idea would be to   			offer this for sale so that other schools could buy and copy it for   			their own use.<br />
      It would be good to think that the trail could be extended to other   			areas of the Park – or adapted for other subject areas.<br />
  <br />
      24. Following Carol singing in the Pavilion last Christmas, Karen   			from the Pickle Jar organised a great programme for Easter,   			including an Easter Bonnet Competition. Sadly, there were only two   			entries… and, as one of the judges, I became interested in ways to   			encourage children and parents to make more use of the Park and its   			facilities – we came up with the idea of an Art Exhibition and sent   			a lot of publicity to all Crewe and Nantwich Schools. However, we   			only had one reply – from Wistaston Green Nursery and Primary   			School.<br />
      As a result, I am in touch with their Art Teacher and have now done   			two displays of some stunning Art work by children from various age   			groups at the school. <br />
      Karen and Mike at the Pickle Jar are pleased and glad to hear that   			these displays can be changed and updated on a regular basis.<br />
      Other schools and groups are obviously welcome to display their work   			and ideas in a similar way.<br />
  <br />
      25. On Friday 19th October, I am meeting Karen again to discuss the   			Christmas programme and ways that the Friends Group can support more   			Carol Singing by local schools in this year&rsquo;s festive season.<br />
  <br />
      Thank you to all for you on-going support.<br />

  <br />
      2.0 Previous Minutes<br />
  <br />
      3.0 Matters arising<br />
      Following previous comments, new bins have been placed in the park.   			Also 2 or 3 benches were placed at the west side, but these were   			moved and/or trashed immediately.<br />
  <br />
      4.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Report &amp; Summary <br />
      (presented by Elaine Dodd as Derek Morgan delayed in traffic)<br />
      The Chair attended a Project update last week with various   			representatives from Cheshire East Council. Whilst we are all aware   			of the outstanding issues, which are frustrating for everyone, he   			was most pleased to see they were making great strides to finalise   			snagging works and move the project forward. We can only hope the   			second application for funding is favourably received by the   			Heritage Lottery. An initial submission has been made and the   			complete business plan is required by August time, so there is a lot   			of information to get together, complicated by what Heritage Lottery   			will fund and what has previously been allocated for funding at the   			last round.<br />
  <br />
      To action works - The local authority now have what is called a   			Corporate Landlord. This Division is extremely supportive regarding   			the Park and has got a grip of making progress and sorting   			Contractors and Consultants information following the retirement of   			Allan Leah. There have been complications as there are design and   			workmanship anomalies and a large lump of contract monies are being   			withheld to ensure these issues get sorted.<br />
  <br />
      It is intended to employ the services of a new Architect and QS to   			again assist in driving things forward. This will help the very   			small team immensely. Such a small staffing level is unknown with   			regard to such projects.<br />
  <br />
      The Management Maintenance plan is finally almost signed off. The   			Heritage Lottery have made comment and provided further advice on   			this, so the final step is to get the council leaders to accept its   			contents. Whilst that might sound strange as written in-house by the   			new Project Officer, it does mean that resources will have to be   			committed on an on-going bases, to ensure the Park gets adequate   			budget provision.<br />
  <br />
      Once again the only works happening at this time are all SNAGGING   			WORKS. The Charles Dick plaque has now been purchased and erected.   			His great Nephew visited from the South and is delighted about our   			efforts. He has left a great deal of historical information with   			Elaine about his great Uncle if anyone would like to call in and see   			it.<br />
  <br />
      Other works have been repairs in response to vandalism. It is   			stressed that all Friends should help be the ears and eyes for the   			Park and dial the Police 101 line for any incidents seen... they   			will respond. There is a Police meeting with Elaine and all security   			partners tomorrow, 3rd July, to hopefully increase their attention   			to the Park. Needless to say there has been an on-going dialogue   			with the Police following recent anti-social behaviour and damage   			caused. The damage to the bridge is most serious as was one of the   			fires to a holly tree, which now has to be removed. Costings for   			various security options have been presented to the Director for   			consideration, including a bid of up to £30k for CCTV – We await   			with interest to see what happens with this; obviously it is   			required sooner rather than later. In the interim, additional   			security is being brought in at staggered times, both during opening   			hours and after closure. Again it will be interesting to see the   			outcome of this and whether or not it is effective. <br />
  <br />
      VOLUNTEERS<br />
      Thank you to those who volunteered to do works around the Park, in   			particular the Bowling Club. Notices up re volunteers for bench   			painting are clearly displayed – thank you for that. <br />
      Do we have any volunteers please to conduct some Market Research? –   			this was put to the last meeting but only one or two volunteered   			–Sheila is still collecting names if you can assist.<br />
  <br />
      Thank you to the volunteers who turned up and supported the Jubilee   			weekend – all of the activities happened through volunteers:<br />
      Lisa Prime, Daniel Prime and Roy Prince who kindly gave up their   			Bank holiday for the Park. <br />
      Thanks also to Howard &amp; Sheila Curran for the Heritage Walks, he has   			now completed two. <br />
      Also, to Sheila Blackburn for clay Modelling and Painting day -   			again supported by volunteers. Thanks to Derek Morgan and Mo Grant   			for kindly giving up their time to help. <br />
  <br />
      EVENTS<br />
      The schools &lsquo;SEAL&rsquo; day happened with Ben Wye who did a fantastic job   			of co-ordinating everyone&rsquo;s involvement. It was great to see so many   			young people enjoying the Park grounds. The Council&rsquo;s Sports   			Development Team also did a fantastic job arranging activities. The   			Friends&rsquo; Secretary is to prepare a letter of thanks to them from us   			all.<br />
  <br />
      A VOICE FOR LIONS....... This will be a talent show, presented by   			The Crewe &amp; Nantwich Lions Association. Charity stand sand stalls   			are also to be invited along. The top prize will be an impressive   			£500! This event is particularly important as there will not be a   			Carnival this year, it will also support the annual visiting   			funfair. Derek will be looking for volunteers to assist over the   			weekend.<br />

      ANY OTHER BUSINESS<br />
      Those present debated the main points of the Chair&rsquo;s Report as   			follows:<br />
  <br />
      ? Fire damage to bridge: confirmed no CEC bridges insured<br />
      ? Meeting with Police: how will they be investigating these criminal   			acts of arson<br />
      ? CCTV: where cameras might be positioned to give maximum coverage   			and how evidence collected might be used<br />
      ? Additional Security: Elaine has costed out various alternatives<br />
      ? Local Councillors: Secretary to write personal letter of   			invitation to each of 12 local councillors to a Friends Committee   			meeting about Security and maintenance. Mike Worthington from The   			Pickle Jar noted that present systems are not working and that we   			need to look at alternatives – his suggestions included Social   			Enterprise to attract funds.<br />
      ? Maintenance agreements: Howard Curran recalled how the old Crewe   			and Nantwich Council allocated funds for (eg) gardeners and noted   			that Cheshire East did away with all such agreements as soon as it   			was established. <br />

  <br />
      4.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Report &amp; Summary<br />
      Derek Morgan presented his report, as follows:<br />
      We are about to enter the next phase of the restoration project as   			CEC has submitted the next Heritage Lottery Grant application to   			finalise work in the Park. This is an initial submission and a   			complete business case project proposal will be required. <br />
      HLF Officers visited in March and appeared to be supportive. Prior   			to the approval of a new application, <br />
      the Management Maintenance plan has to be signed off. This is now in   			its final stage and must be <br />
      compiled by the end of May. It is a lengthy document, detailing the   			whole profile of the Park, the area, <br />
      benefits, programmes, potential, historical aspect, users and so on.<br />
  <br />
      Current programmed works are to do with snagging - there is no new   			investment at present. <br />
      Work includes repairs due to vandalism, snagging the new bin store   			at the Pavilion, automatic <br />
      doors and ventilation in the Pavilion. Lake handrails are about to   			be extended and there is work <br />
      needed on building alarms, plus earth moving to assist levelling and   			pedestrian access.<br />
  <br />
      Electronic and computer connections in the Lodge have been   			completed, although there are still some problems with the line. The   			office also has a new telephone number – 01270 686708, however, the   			old number goes through normally to Elaine&rsquo;s mobile.<br />
      It is still intended to demolish the old depot and the old toilet   			block and further details will follow.<br />
      VOLUNTEERS<br />
      Thank you to those who volunteered to do work, in particular to the   			Bowing Club. Regarding other volunteer tasks, the Park is pretty   			much litter free at the moment, so we thought it would be useful to   			conduct some Market Research. Those who would like to help with the   			collection of questionnaires from users, please let Sheila know and   			we can plan a day - possibly on a Sunday as this is the day when the   			Park is at its busiest. ACTION - ALL<br />
  <br />
      WARDEN ISSUE<br />
      The local press covered the loss of the last Warden in last week&rsquo;s   			Chronicle. A letter has been sent to the Chief Exec to formalise the   			Friends concerns and disappointment that Cheshire East Council has   			not heard Friends pleas which have fallen on deaf ears. <br />
      Small scale issues continue to be a problem, there are regular   			meetings with our Security partners, but they too are having cut   			backs in services. <br />
  <br />
  <br />
      A log of incidents is being maintained; please report anything to   			Elaine, so that we can demonstrate the need for resources. Also,   			ring the police on 101.<br />
  <br />
      EVENTS<br />
      Regarding Community use and Eventing, posters are now available,   			kindly designed by a new Friend member, Ian Gollins. Please display   			wherever you can – please ask in your local shop, Post Officer,   			School, Club etc. ACTION - ALL<br />
      Posters will distribute to all Council venues.<br />
      The programme given was discussed in detail.<br />
      5.0 SEALS Event update by Ben Wyre<br />
      Ben reminded the meeting that some 300 school pupils will be   			attending a day&rsquo;s activities on 20th June. A problem has occurred -   			the Water Safety Team will no longer be able to attend and   			alternative activities are being considered / looked for. The   			meeting debated:<br />
       Using photos to set a trail/questionnaire for the children. <br />
       Using the Bowling Green to teach children how to play and how to   			respect the facility (suggested previously) <br />
       Blue Cross<br />
       Forest Schools Ant Course<br />
       <br />
      The event will be cancelled if the weather is bad. Volunteers would   			be appreciated. <br />
      ACTION - ALL<br />
  <br />
      6.0 Silver Casket Auction<br />
      It had come to the Parks attention that the actual Sliver Cask   			presented at the time of the QP dedication had recently come up for   			auction., this being of significant historical value to QP and   			Crewe. CEC could not finance a bid – the item had a reserve price of   			£3,500, However, CEC did source a sponsor, who was prepared to bid   			up to £5,500. In the event, the casket was sold for £8,000 (£10,000   			with commission) and is now in the hands of a private collector. The   			Auction House has been contacted with a view to asking if the item   			might be brought to Crewe for viewing<br />
      7.0 AOB – Q &amp; A&rsquo;s:<br />
      Steps: It was noted that an elderly park visitor fell down the steps   			to the bowling green recently. Bronwyn Dean pointed out that the   			steps need handrails and she agreed to e-mail the Project Officer   			about this. <br />
      It was also noted that a fence is needed to stop cyclists doing   			stunts and landing on the green.<br />
      Events and Gazebos: Volunteers for the events programme were told   			that the two Cheshire East Gazebos, stored in the Park Depot, are   			too heavy to erect without appropriate staff. They need weights   			which are too heavy to lift- and also the &ldquo;buggy&rdquo; to transport them   			round the site. The meeting discussed where the Friends would hold   			their activities and stalls and were told that the only option is   			the West Lodge House or Games Pavilion, both of which are not   			central. Reluctantly, it was agreed that the Jubilee Event on 4th   			June would be a trial to determine how effective this new   			arrangement will be. &ldquo;The Friends of Queens Park should surely have   			a stall in a prominent position?&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  <br />
      Seats: Sheila Blackburn asked if seats could be provided to the west   			of the Park near to the Bandstand. Lack of seats in this area is   			proving a difficulty for elderly park users who would appreciate   			more places to rest. It was noted that new furniture in the Park   			will have to be in line with a uniform design – it was suggested   			that extra seating from the edge of the bowling green could be used   			in the short term, as long as specifically named benches are not   			relocated.<br />
      ACTION – CG – RELOCATE BENCHES AS APPROPRIATE<br />
  <br />
      Bins: Sheila Blackburn asked if bins could be placed to the south of   			the lake near to the Moreton Road entrance. It was noted that, in   			the past, bins had been set alight and burned out here. Charlie   			Griffies stated that CEC was unlikely to fund any more litter bins   			at all. In response to this – and in view of the problem with lack   			of Wardens (social and security) and events issues above, - Sheila   			expressed concern and dismay that CEC seemed to be relying on   			volunteers to do work that was previously the job of paid staff. SB   			stating - <br />
  &ldquo;Voluntary work and activities are supposed to be in addition to the   			running of the Park, a sort of bolt-on, not a substitute for   			necessary staffing. It is inappropriate to expect volunteers to take   			on jobs that require paid and trained employees, -- the few   			volunteers we have are working in their own time, usually at   			weekends, Bank Holidays and prime family times. They cannot and must   			not be taken for granted nor relied on to make regular commitments   			to further save money (as suggested in one of the few replies   			received from the Chief Exec department). This is not the way   			forward; it is not progress and is not the way to follow up a £6.5m   			restoration project.&rdquo; <br />
      Traffic Calming on Queens Park Drive: The meeting was divided in its   			views about the effectiveness and safety of the traffic calming.<br />
      Fence on Burma Star Island: the purpose of this is to be   			investigated and the meeting hopes to hear how long the fence is to   			be in place.<br />
      Burma Star memorial: Veterans had been consulted regarding   			potentially a new memorial replacement – again this would be part of   			the second HLF bid. .<br />
      Notice Boards: Two more notice boards are needed at the South (Moreton   			Road) and West (George Playing Fields) Gates. ACTION - ED two new   			boards<br />
      Floating Islands: The Rangers have now installed floating islands to   			encourage the swans and Grebes to nest in safer places. Incidents of   			cruelty to the Park wildlife should be reported <br />
      ACTION - (Ring - 101 as above)<br />
  <br />
      Help for Elaine: It was pointed out that Elaine&rsquo;s position as Park   			Manager previously involved a number of staff – this role is valued   			and support from the Friends Group is needed.<br />

      3.0 Matters Arising from the Minutes<br />
      Question re: Capital Investment discussed at a previous meeting -   			This was deferred to the Chair&rsquo;s Report.<br />
      4.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Report &amp; Summary<br />
      Firstly thank you for coming along and Welcome to our Guest speakers   			– talking about:<br />
      1. Crewe Urban Vision – Objectives and Partnership Potential –   			welcome to Adrian &amp; Deb Lindop<br />
      2. Jubilee Crewe Celebrations - welcome to Dawn Clark – Local Area   			Partnership <br />
      3. Queens Park an Educational Venue - welcome to Ben Wyre – Crewe   			Partnership Co-Ordinator<br />
  <br />
      As for the project itself we are about to enter into the next   			interesting phase as Cheshire East Council have just submitted the   			First Phase of Application for the next Heritage Lottery Grant   			Application to finalise works and we are all aware of what is   			outstanding and the works priorities. <br />
  <br />
      A HLF Officer is to visit on the 26th March and it is so important   			that we present a good image and united front, to push the project   			forward, to gain what we hope will be a positive response from them   			in assisting to fund the outstanding works.<br />
  <br />
      The chair reflected on QP issues:<br />
      We all need to communicate the message about we are where we are...   			the level of investment we received was and is significant and   			probably greater than any other Council has provided for other   			public parks. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided a grant of just   			under £3m and the remaining funds of £3.5m were from other external   			funding organisations, such as WREN and capital reserves of the   			former Crewe and Nantwich Council, so it has not been funded by the   			Council tax as stated in some press publications. <br />
  <br />
      Remembering too that when the Park opened 100+ years ago – she was   			not complete, much of the infra-structure and associated facilities   			did not exist, so there was nothing to create or maintain. Also,   			additional expenditure has been incurred as works have literally   			uncovered the unknown – such as potential roadway collapse into the   			Park from part of the Victoria Ave road network, then we have had   			bats, ecologists, power cables, drainage investigations, wildlife /   			fowl protection, a phenomenal amount of silt and its relocation from   			the lake....<br />
  <br />
      Much of the work at the moment is behind the scenes, particularly   			with regard to ensuring <br />
      there are appropriate funds and resources to maintain the Park in   			future years. The Management Maintenance Plan, is actively being   			drawn together, although the Chair commented he considered this   			should have already been finalised and agreed at the last   			application. Once completed, this will have to be approved by the   			Heritage Lottery Fund and will also be required to be finished and   			considered before they are able to confirm any additional funding.   			Talks so far are optimistic.<br />
  <br />
      Works programmed at this time are to do with SNAGGING WORKS,<br />
      there is no new investment at this time. For example, there is still   			some works required in the new toilets mainly for the tiling, which   			is outstanding. The works in the cafe include some roofing repairs,   			also repairs following vandalism, which has already been done to   			remove graffiti and to much damage done to storage doors under the   			veranda area. Also, the doors have had constant problems with the   			automatic electronic mechanism, this has taken a long time to sort   			out but appears to now be repaired after a long battle! There is a   			similar story with regards to the under floor heating. A new   			external store area is shortly to be built on the side of the cafe   			pavilion, mainly to assist with deliveries and the storage of bins   			which is a fire risk at this time.<br />
  <br />
      Electronic and computer connections are on-going in the lodges and   			they to require some remedial end of contract works to be finished.   			We hope to have our Manager, Elaine, in-situ shortly.<br />
  <br />
      Hand rails have now been ordered to add to the bridges and some   			earth moving around the access points also.<br />
  <br />
      There are some works programmed for earth moving on the rough   			footpaths on the West side of the Lodge as you go down to Coronation   			Valley, mainly to achieve DDA requirements and to prevent potential   			nasty falls on the present steep incline.<br />
  <br />
      Plans are being drawn upon to demolish the old depot area and I will   			let you know more about that once details are know,<br />
  <br />
      Also, l there are some tidying works to the base of the memorial   			where the planted beds are. These will be reformatted so you cannot   			see the inner cement and also chains to be replaced.<br />
  <br />
      Requests re volunteers for small maintenance works were   			disappointing in that, only 4 signed up at the AGM, plus 2   			electronic members. If you are willing, fit and able and have   			appropriate skills, please give Sheila our Secretary all of your   			details.<br />
  <br />
      In particular Friends would like to arrange a small working party to <br />
      Power wash benches and re-oil. Could include some small joinery   			repair works.<br />
      Power wash bins and rebrand – Queens Park stickers are ready to   			reattach.<br />
      And LITTER BLITZ around the Park generally.<br />
  <br />
      Regarding Community use and Eventing, Elaine issued a list of the   			confirmed Events <br />
      programmes to date at Item 8. We await details of next year&rsquo;s budget   			allocation, for promotions and events, if any...!!! However, we have   			received a lot of positive responses from the Community plus support   			from The Pickle Jar Lakeside Pavilion to stage events and engage the   			community in activities in the Park all of which will greatly help   			and contribute to our lottery application. There have been some   			fantastic educational opportunities explored thanks to the   			co-orientation of Bed Wyre see Item 7. A thank you to Ben was   			expressed, and also some fantastic news about Orienteering in the   			Park. Plus, our own Secretary Sheila has undertaken at least one   			session, so thank you Sheila, as has Tim Prevett who is known for   			his Ghost Walks. The Parks Manager was thanked for her co-ordination   			– all are helping us to achieve these all important educational   			opportunities and benefits, which is great news for the Park.<br />
  <br />
      Finally, Stef Townsend, our valued last remanding Park Warden is   			taking Voluntary Redundancy due to the loss of this position.   			Despite our petition dated 2nd December 2011, pleas to the CEC Chief   			Executive and my media releases – all protective measures have been   			unsuccessful; this is a sad loss for the Park in losing Stef but   			also a sad loss for the Park&rsquo;s project, as we are left in a most   			comprising position regarding security and potential issues and   			risks. Police, PCSO&rsquo;s and CEC Wardens, are all kindly on-board to   			assist us, however in reality they will not be here 24 / 7 and they   			too have undergone a reduction of resources. The Chair is to convey   			again grievance about this formally again to Cheshire East Council,   			but noted all so far have been on deaf ears. A big thank you to Cllr   			Dorothy Flude also for pursuing this matter in great lengths for   			both Stef and Queens Park. Stef, &ldquo;we wish you all the very best in   			the future and thank you sincerely for all your hard works, efforts,   			park improvements, and long hours worked, covering also in difficult   			times for a valued member of staff sadly lost to us.&rdquo; <br />
      5.0 Events in 2012<br />
      Adrian / Deb Lindop - Crewe Urban Vision<br />
      The group presented outlined principles, vision and ongoing works of   			projects, including possible links and shared resources between CUV   			and the Friends of Queens Park.<br />
      Local Area Partnership: this is a valuable opportunity for groups   			such as ours to work together and to apply collectively for support.   			It was considered opportunities and a sharing of volunteers could be   			explored.<br />

      8.0 Elaine Dodd presented a hand-out of forthcoming events in the   			Park.<br />
      These depend on the new budget and are still to be confirmed.<br />
      Details to follow as above.<br />
      9.0 AOB<br />
      Q: Refurbishment of Burma Star Island as at meeting in November 2011<br />
      A; Refer to Chair&rsquo;s Report above re all funding.<br />
      Note: there are specific times in the year when applications for   			funding can be made; ideas and visions for further improvements to   			Park areas are still in hand.<br />
  <br />
      Q: Lions Sensory Garden and Dave Wilcox support group who are   			interested in a low allergy garden – could the two groups work   			together on this?<br />
      A: Nothing further has been heard from representation form C&amp;N Lions   			to Project Consultant (Heritage) of 2 years ago, who have presented   			proposals re a sensory garden. There could be some conflict of   			interest in this and it will have to be given further consideration. <br />
      Ben Wyre talked about Adelaide School wishing to establish a   			Butterfly Garden, working with teenage apprentices.<br />
      Elaine Dodd indicated that the East Lodge garden could become a   			Community Garden.<br />
  <br />
      Q: Lake debris: is there any provision in the maintenance budget for   			the removal of the debris?<br />
      A: There is no extra/specific money but removal is part of ongoing   			grounds and maintenance work.<br />
  <br />
      Q: From a parent of a two year old. Re: deterioration of toddlers   			playground equipment from vandalism – are there any plans or   			contingencies for repairs or agreements with Wicksteed to maintain?<br />
      A; (Charlie Griffiths) The equipment is inspected regularly in line   			with requirements and this includes an annual National Safety   			Inspection.<br />
  <br />
      Q: If there is no longer a Park Warden, could Special Constables be   			used?<br />
      A: Personnel such as PCSO and the Police do visit the Park to check,   			there is also a Security Group which meet that consists of PSCOs,   			Police, Wardens, LAP, etc, representatives. The chair stressed the   			situation was less than ideal.<br />
  <br />
      Q: (From Bowls Club Chairman) The problems incurred at the Lakeside   			Pavilion apply to the Games Pavilion – what measures are/ can be put   			in place to prevent these?<br />
      A: Shutters were not part of the budget for the new buildings and   			might be seen as something of a challenge for troublemakers! A   			recent break-in at The Lakeside Pavilion is viewed as exceptional –   			not experienced at the old café. The situation will be monitored.<br />

      3<br />
  <br />
      Chairperson&rsquo;s Report<br />
      Derek Morgan presented his report for the year.<br />
  <br />
      He thanked all those attending and supporting the Park refurbishment   			and its further development. He also noted the excellent progress   			that has been made, the major events over the last twelve months and   			looked forward to the year ahead and the possibility of further work   			and improvements. <br />
  <br />
      Derek noted the importance of press coverage for events and thanked   			the Parks Manager for undertaking media releases, and for these   			ongoing concerns and issue which are very much worth supporting.<br />
  <br />
      It was also noted that there have been a number problems, such as a   			gate opening at weekend and the ongoing concern about the deletion   			of warden posts. <br />
  <br />
      Looking to the year ahead, there will be a lot going on – and   			attendees were encouraged to sign the volunteers list, especially   			for minor works (probably Sundays) and for identified events from   			the forthcoming Summer programme.<br />
  <br />
      This was confirmed by Roy Cartlidge, who listed Spring Watch,   			anniversaries for The Heritage Centre and the Queen&rsquo;s Jubilee, plus   			the Olympic Torch, amongst others. Such local community events   			enable us all to become involved and to promote the Park. He also   			spoke of a Music event and asked the Friends Group to support it.<br />

      He reminded the meeting that, last year, it was suggested to elect   			these Officers for a 3 year term This has assisted with planning,   			plus getting ourselves into this new role and banking requirements   			like authorised signatures for cheques, charity status bank account   			and so on.<br />
      It does not distract from the option to &lsquo;boot&rsquo; us out if you do not   			think we are performing. <br />
  <br />
      Clause 6e states where a vote of &lsquo;no confidence&rsquo; can be brought   			against a member of the committee, if approved by 2/3rd of those   			attending, that member will be removed from office. <br />
  <br />
      I intended to exclude from the above the Fund Raising Officer   			position as consider we need to review this position and establish   			costings for proposals. We need to develop realistic expectations   			whilst we are a relatively young group. The Chair will speak to the   			Officer personally.

      8 Presentation by Derek Morgan to Allan Leah<br />
  <br />
      I would like to welcome Allan Leah who has kindly taken time from   			his busy retirement to come along and join us today...<br />
  <br />
      Allan, we consider, is the brains behind the Queens Park Renovation   			Project, having picked up the pieces form a number of Officers   			involved in its original conception.<br />
  <br />
      Starting with Peter Booth, who many will remember as Conservation   			Officer for Crewe &amp; Nantwich Borough Council, who had the idea back   			in the year 2000 to renovate the Park with the kind support of a   			Heritage Lottery Fund and application grant. Allan, for his sins,   			worked very closely with Peter and has stayed with the project up   			until now.<br />
  <br />
      The Stage 1 bid was made back in January 2001 and the Stage 2   			submitted and approved on the 14th March 2005 when the project first   			commenced in its early stages.<br />
  <br />
      Peter left during this period as did his replacement Steve Corbett,   			so Allan took the reigns firmly and maintained continuity being   			seconded as Project Officer in January 2006.<br />
  <br />
      Allan accepted voluntary redundancy and early retirement at the end   			of September 2011 and we feel was a sad loss to the progress made   			and his achievements. Not often does anyone retire and leave behind   			such a legacy which will continue beyond all of our life years!!<br />
  <br />
      He is very proud of what has been achieved and has undergone and   			worked through many milestones for the greater good in the end.<br />
  <br />
      So, I ask the Crewe Mayor, Cllr Roy Cartlidge and Elaine Dodd our   			Manager, to join me in asking Allan to accept this small keepsake   			from CEC and the Friends of Queens Park as a small momentum and   			reminder in years to come of his achievements and professionalism,   			what a pleasure it has been to work with him.<br />
  <br />
      Allan said, &ldquo;I am confident that the remaining works will be   			completed under the guidance of Cheshire East Council with key   			officers including George Broughton the Parks Development Officer   			together with Elaine Dodd, Queens Parks Manager and now in charge,   			Gareth Edwards Head of Department. I wish the project all the very   			best for the future and shall be watching its completion with much   			satisfaction – good luck to all involved and thank you for your   			continued support.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
      9 Questions, Answers and Suggestions<br />
  <br />
      Q: (Howard Curran)<br />
      As I have not yet received a reply from the CE, I wonder if my   			letter about the Wardens has been sent?<br />
      A: It was delivered last week by hand (Fri 2nd Dec).<br />
  <br />
      Q: What will the Friends Group fund raising monies be used for?<br />
      A: this has to be decided, but a reserve amount should be agreed.<br />
  <br />
      Mo Grant proposed a vote of thanks to Derek Morgan for all his work   			as our Chairman.<br />

      No Item 1.0 Apologies<br />
      Noted. 2.0 Previous Minutes<br />
      The minutes of the last meeting were agreed as correct. 3.0 Matters   			Arising from the Minutes<br />
      None. 4.0 Events Review:<br />
      Visit by HRH Duchess of Gloucester: July<br />
      Re-opening Celebration: September<br />
      There was a lot involved in bringing the Royal event together which   			fortunately, or unfortunately, was a big commitment for QP Manager,   			Elaine Dodd, who co-ordinated both events. Time commitment for both   			the re-opening event and the HRH visit, the latter having been   			invited 2 years previously. The amount of protocol for this,   			security and director liaison was time consuming but necessary.   			Julie Stockton for pre event support from CEC Comms supported the   			HRH visit. <br />
  <br />
      For the QP Re-opening Event between 30 – 40 organisations were   			involved, which given the dwindling support of recent events was   			refreshing, demonstrating that the public really were ready for a   			Celebration at this time.<br />
  <br />
      The date was changed from Carnival, as schools returned from half   			term, which we considered would help involvement overall.<br />
  <br />
      PROCESSION<br />
      Formal road closure application. Notices erected stayed in situ. <br />
      Excellent Police communications. Police were very pleased with   			arrangements, their support valued.<br />
      Excellent school workshops and co-ordination by Maria Boone and   			Sarah McKenzie. These were arranged and financed by CEC, supported   			by these excellent art workers.<br />
      Disappointed by one school – only 2 x pupils attended. They had two   			workshops at a cost to us of around £500. School attendances costly   			but worthwhile when pupils support – how can we ensure they attend   			in the future? <br />
  <br />
      STAGE<br />
      Outdoor PA some &lsquo;cutting off&rsquo; of sound, ED to speak to sound   			engineer. <br />
      Still considered to be a better option than a closed PA unit.<br />
      Lack of light on stage – darker than anticipated at an earlier time.   			ACTION<br />
  <br />
      ARENA &amp; ACTIVITIES<br />
      No issues.<br />
      Ropes partially dismantled by crowds prior to StarQuest, staff   			elsewhere to reinstate as helping with daylight Fireworks, and   			putting out chairs / tables for SQ Judges. <br />
      Bowling pav keys not available – they are now!<br />
  <br />
      Wildlife Trust, Crewe Heritage Centre, Reaseheath College, RNLI, the   			LAP, West St Christiania Fellowship, Crewe Concert Band, the   			Heritage Centre, CAT fm, Reggie DJ, Horticulture Soc; all very   			pleased with involvement and equipment provided. Volume, who   			arranged the music show were self sufficient and did an excellent   			live band co-ordination. Plus, activities provided by - Liberty   			Morris Troupe, St Michaels Troupe&rsquo; Air Training Corp. Fire Services   			and Corp, the Wingate Centre, BLITZ fireworks, Railroaders American   			Football Club, Shavington Village Fest Committee, Play &amp; Sport Dev,   			Waste Watch, Crewe Sea Cadets, community trade &amp; charity stands.   			StarQuest finalists also. Supported by a limited number of paid   			performers ie Street Artists etc also.<br />
  <br />
      ACCESS<br />
      Too tight. Turing circles and access needs to be improved and   			widened when depot works completed. This will also help general QP   			deliveries. ACTION<br />
  <br />
      PYROS / FIREWORKS<br />
      Disabled area not achieved. Time and crowd issue – needs to be   			placed in advance. ACTION <br />
      Wind issue – beyond our control.<br />
  <br />
      ADMINISTRATION / ORGANISATION<br />
      Event co-ordinated by QP Manager. Supported kindly by retired QP   			Warden, Garvis Upton, who kindly attended to assist with cheque   			payments and distribution, plus Sheila who assisted with some   			distribution and Derek with evacuation procedure. Really required a   			dedicated clerk / admin to assist. <br />

      BUDGET Total Income 7255 Budget 10000 CwTrustees 10000 ProjectCont   			5929 25929 So Thank you to all!!! 5.0 Chairperson&rsquo;s Report<br />
      Derek Morgan asked the meeting to celebrate and be proud of the work   			that has been completed in the Park todate. He also reminded the   			group that the original Park was not finished when it was opened   			over 100 years ago – many features were added later. We can all see   			where the project is up to in terms of what has been done, so I   			don&rsquo;t think a good use of limited time to go over this once   			again....<br />
  <br />
      But what is worth mentioning that the level of investment in   			features is significant and probably greater than any other Council   			has provided for other public parks. The Heritage Lottery Fund   			provided a grant of just under £3m and the remaining funds of £3.5m   			were from other external funding organisations, such as WREN and   			capital reserves of the former Crewe and Nantwich Council, so you   			will appreciate that it has not been funded by the Council tax as   			stated in some press publications.<br />
  <br />
      On the down side we are equally frustrated the park is not complete,   			including the Officers who are here tonight. <br />
      Might I just mention that when the Park opened 100+ years ago – it   			was not complete, there was no lake, just the Brook culverting   			underneath, some of the buildings were added later, there was only   			one entrance, no playground, no bowling green, no planted main drive   			avenue, so features, trees and planting were added over many years;   			the infra structure we all know today, was 20 years in the making   			and took 100 years to evolve. Added to the fact that it is obvious   			to all local people that the Park has not had a dedicated budget   			spent on the grounds in a number of years which has further   			exasperated the situation. <br />
      So, lets look forward not back, - a great deal has been achieved. <br />
      The way forward <br />
      CEC are actively seeking additional funds to ensure that works are   			progressed as soon as an agreement can be achieved.<br />
      Talks so far with the HLF are ongoing and we are optimistic that   			they will be able to provide additional funds to maintain the   			momentum of the restoration package. This is good news as it will be   			an extension of the existing grant and not a reapplication.<br />
      Consultants are preparing a schedule of outstanding works and   			associated costs, taking into account works recently completed and   			in progress. This is being produced along with a Maintenance and   			Management Plan which will establish enhanced maintenance standards,   			so that the park does not go into decline in the future, this is   			essential for the on-going future standards within the park.<br />
      The Lake<br />
      The weed was blanket weed which although an eyesore, has been dealt   			with, with permissions gained by our Queens Park Manager following   			discussions and permits form the Environment Agency. However, it   			will probably return next year as a more permanent solution is   			required, under the Maintenance and Management Plan. The good news   			however, is that the blooms were not of the blue green algal type,   			which has meant in the past that the lake waters were closed off for   			a number of summers over the past 20 years, -this seems to get   			forgotten about. Carp has been observed in the lake – although this   			will eat the self seeding plants it will murk up the clear waters.<br />
      The Bridges<br />
      Hand rails have yet to be extended. We await the design from   			consultants for these. The effects of settlement on the structures   			has needed to be determined for the design as they will settle and   			move further. But this item is outstanding and requires actioning at   			the earliest time.<br />
      Memorial<br />
      Loose granite chippings around the Boer War Memorial were temporary   			for the HRH visit and will be replaced with cut stone to match the   			existing granite. This memorial had a large amount of topsoil around   			it for many years which buried the lower parts of the listed   			structure and it was only when the topsoil was removed that the   			lower walls were revealed and the lions restored to their original   			position. It is proposed to turn the planting beds into steps, this   			will be delayed as listed building consent is required to commence   			works, but once done visitors will be able to get closer to the   			names inscribed and research the history of this campaign. The   			Queens Park Manager has spoken to Reaseheath College who are   			interested in doing a temporary solution in readiness for   			Remembrance Day which is good news.<br />
      Snagging Works<br />
      Yes, there are snagging works, which are realistic on large scale   			engineering and construction projects. Some of the new toilets   			require remedial works mainly for the tiling. We have agreed that   			the Pickle Jar do not leave the toilets open, which was the original   			intention, but will be sealed off if the cafe is not open. This is   			purely because people DO NOT value these facilities and the level of   			vandalism and mis-use is simply unacceptable. These operators need a   			starting chance to provide clean and welcoming facilities for   			visitors; and unkempt, vandalised toilets are simply not acceptable   			to the element of society who expect, as they should, clean toilets.<br />
      There are toilets which are open daily by the Games pavilion,   			however should these suffer in the same way as the old ones, again   			the times of opening will need to be restricted... so we watch with   			interest and caution regarding these facilities.<br />
      LODGES<br />
      We await only the IT connections. There is some under road ducting   			to be done to complete the telephone and IT service connections, to   			get these buildings back into use. Under road connections are   			necessary as the Conservation Officer has stated that no eternal   			lines are to be fitted to the exterior walls Lodges themselves. We   			will be, most pleased to see Elaine the Manager return and to be   			able to provide our Grounds Team a more fitting work space than they   			currently have which is the depot area (which frankly needs to be   			demolished as soon as…).<br />
      We need also - Lighting at footpath level, new benches which can be   			donated also, new bins, signage and street furniture, funded form   			any balances and again ongoing annual maintenance budgets. 6.0 Any   			Other Business - Q &amp; A&rsquo;s Roy Cartlidge thanked Elaine Dodd for all   			her hard work arranging both the HRH visit and the Re-Opening Event.   			VOTING<br />
      CHAIRS CLARIFICATION – All members can vote at the AGM, voting is   			for the core committee only at ordinary meetings, however issues can   			be open to the &lsquo;floor&rsquo; should a group decision be required. In the   			event of an equality in voting, the Chairperson may cast a second   			deciding vote. Please refer to Constitution – available upon   			request. Q: Are people aware of the need for volunteers?<br />
      A: Yes, through e-mails and advice at our meetings. All help is   			appreciated and anyone is welcome at any of our events. Q: Are local   			colleges invited to help?<br />
      A: Yes. All were advised of the event and the help needed. Neither   			could commit this year. Q: Bentley vehicle charge?<br />
      A: No charge for 2 x vehicles provided. Volunteers<br />
      BONFIRE NIGHT <br />
      November 5th is just around the corner for Fund Raising for the   			Friends and Lions and support is required.<br />
      If you are supporting any of the events programme, where children   			involved, you will have to have at least one member of your team   			with a CRB registration.<br />
  <br />
      A number of people stopped us at the reopening event stating they   			would be prepared to do some hands-on maintenance activities... so   			we are proposing a number of projects to help with small works   			around the Park.<br />
  <br />
      Power wash benches and re-oil. Could include some small joinery   			repair works.<br />
      Suggest these are divided into areas, due to the numbers involved <br />
      ie main drive, <br />
      playground drive<br />
      Lake surround / Others<br />
  <br />
      Power wash bins and rebrand – we have Queens Park stickers ready to   			reattach.<br />
  <br />
      You must confirm if you have suitable safety clothing to complete   			works, or if you will require any of the following:<br />
      Sturdy footwear – (if you have nothing suitable sorry will probably   			won&rsquo;t be able to use your help).<br />
      But CEC can provided:<br />
      Safety Gloves<br />
      Overalls<br />
      Glasses if needed<br />
      Face mask<br />
      Materials as required<br />
  <br />
      So, please inform Sheila at end of meeting of your availability, any   			skills and willingness.<br />

      Please see Sheila with ALL of your contact details even if you have   			already registered in with us, what works you are interest in   			assisting with and your availability, also any particular skills you   			have i.e. joiner, painting, welding...<br />
  <br />
      FOOTPATHS<br />
      Q Raised by a number of attendees. The completion of the footpath   			system will be a high priority as soon as funding is available. In   			addition to the HLF application extension, CEC has applied for a   			£500k capital investment. This money will be reinvested to support   			the footpath works together with a landscape scheme for the Burma   			Star Island featuring a new Burma Star memorial – this will be the   			highest priority for landscaping as will the improvements needed to   			the Coronation Walk Valley which will involve recreating the manmade   			artificial water course.<br />
      Men in Sheds<br />
      Cllr R Cartlidge suggested these as a contact for &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; works   			for manpower with skills. <br />
  <br />
      S. Chesh Ornithological Soc<br />
      Was suggested by Cllr Cartlidge, as a potential contact to get   			involved with Spring Watch. <br />
      Letter to Chief Executive of CEC via Alderman H Curran from Chair –   			re: Warden ISSUE<br />
      The Chair had written a letter to the Chronicle featured in this   			weeks press as no direct response had been received from CEC CE.   			Passed down to her staff for response. Also, conflicting information   			had been given from past Cllrs/Members. A letter is to be drafted to   			raise this concern again and forwarded via Alderman H Curran. <br />
      FACEBOOK<br />
      Re &lsquo;Postings&rsquo; - If there any contentious or personality issues   			please can you come through the Chair.... I apologise if any recent   			comments offended any of our new or original members. Volunteers<br />
      Derek invited volunteers to register at this meeting to commit to   			work in the Park, such as restoring benches and weekend   			litter-picking.<br />
      The Secretary of the Friends Group will set up this register which   			will be available at the next meeting. Heritage Walk<br />
      Howard Curran was asked if he would lead a heritage walk in the Park   			in 2012 and he agreed. Dates to be arranged and Howard suggested   			producing an information leaflet in advance. CRB checks<br />
      The meeting was reminded that all volunteers etc must be CRB checked   			to work with children and young people – this is thought to be for   			those working on a regular basis and not for one-off events. It is   			recommended that at least one Friend is CRB checked for children&rsquo;s   			activities/events.<br />
      Wardens<br />
      The position of Park wardens and the Friends Group Petition was   			raised. <br />
      Derek Morgan, as Chair, explained that he has now received letters   			from the Chief Exec and from Edward Timpson, MP. Derek maintains   			that the group needs to be very determined about pushing for action   			on this matter, especially in view of:<br />
      Recent vandalism in the old toilets <br />
      Vandalism to the newly refurbished shelter at the southern (Moreton   			Road) Gate.<br />
      There was much discussion and agreement that action, not further   			meetings and processes is needed, the last Warden subject to   			potential redeployed.<br />
      There was some confusion over what would happen if he is redeployed   			and the payment of services required by the security company.<br />
      It was agreed that members of the committee will frame a letter /   			question to the Chief exec and that Howard Curran, as Alderman, will   			send it to her, prompting her to reply.<br />

  <br />
      Dave Lumley - Site Manager Tolent<br />
      QP Manager acknowledged that Dave would be shortly leaving the   			Queens Park to move onto his next project. Stating he had been a   			pleasure to work with, extremely professional and helpful, a vote of   			thanks was given to Dave for all of his hard works and commitment.<br />
  <br />
      Applause!<br />
      A vote of thanks was presented from the Fundraising Officer and   			supported by the Friends to - the Consultants, Design Team and   			Project Officer, also to the Parks Manager for the HRH visit and   			eventing. <br />
  <br />
      The Chair also thanked all of the volunteers for their extra   			commitment – stating we need more Friends to also support the   			events.<br />

      A presentation was viewed by the group to review the project.   			Focusing on completed or near completed aspects. <br />
  <br />
      Including a new Pavilion, Bowls Pavilion – with integral toilets and   			store, Boer War memorial – Tommy Atkins restoration,   			Bandstand…completed a year last Friday, Monkey Shelter – original   			flat roof now zinc, much earlier support posts repairs were done   			with cement not effective as water seeps up concrete, new wooden   			legs now made, Playground shelter – one complete new support cast   			column made, Clock Tower – Queens nose is to be replaced with an   			appropriately shaped stone indent. Trees re-planted and removed, 2 x   			Lodges, Entrance pillars cleaned, Railings and Gates – although   			curved area and gates to finish, Depot Gates will look like   			railings, – Crewe Town logo to go onto new gates, Traffic calming.<br />
  <br />
      Some provision for limited parking would be made in the depot.<br />
      Coronation Valley and Lake vantage point al yet to complete.<br />
  <br />
      ED - A plaque acknowledging CHARLES DICK J.P. (1838-1888)<br />
      is to be installed onto Monkey shelter following agreement by   			family. Howard Curran gave further historical detail.<br />
  <br />
      The Management Maintenance Plan is a HLF requirement, which   			constitutes a 10 year plan. Will incorporate horticulture aspects,   			community garden, gulf war memorial, etc… designs and   			specifications. Consultation concludes end of September 2011. It   			will be a public document.<br />
      The group considered Crewe was a poor relation to Macclesfield. <br />
  <br />
      5.0 A summary of the VIP visit made to the project by the Duchess of   			Gloucester was given, the visit had received good media support. A   			thank you was expressed to all who were involved in this and   			associated events.<br />
      6.0 Re-Opening Event Sat 10th September – all of the Friends were   			charged with getting involved with the event. Volunteers to date had   			been the usual few for which the group are grateful. However,   			everyone is expected to become involved on the 10th, even if only in   			fancy dress, or getting an organisation to come along and support   			the day, or a display or activity….. see Elaine to confirm what you   			can contribute please! <br />
      Q&amp;A <br />
      Q. Would charging apply on car park? A. no, not at this time.<br />
  <br />
      Q. Will CEC honour the MMP content? A. If it doesn&rsquo;t HLF could   			reclaim monies invested. HLF are withholding the final payment of   			the grant until they are satisfied with the MMP and it is unlikely   			that they will provide a grant for restoring any other historic   			parks in Cheshire East until Queens Park is fully restored and a   			suitable maintenance regime is in place and adopted by the Council.<br />
  <br />
      Q. Blanket weed on the Lake unsightly. A. The Env Agency warned us   			that this would happen. Dormant pods would have been re-born when   			waters reintroduced into the lake. Also, no water movement. Project   			Officer was seeing to take measure to ensure this was removed. Will   			be a future MMP requirement.<br />
  <br />
      Q. What is the Warden petition situation? A. Posts now deleted from   			the establishment. CE to be presented with petition at the earliest   			opportunity. Chair/Sec to action. <br />
  <br />
      Q. Are there any restrictions on the café Licensing times. A. I will   			confirm this for you and attach to them minutes…. <br />
  <br />
      Extract - Premises license Extract - Annex 2 - Conditions consistent   			with Operating Schedule-<br />

      should stop at 00:30 hours and recorded music at 02:00 hours.<br />

      Friends Chairperson&rsquo;s Update and works in progress<br />
      Derek Morgan presented his report.<br />
      ( Comments and questions arising are itemised below ) <br />
  <br />
      i. Pavilions – Contractor &lsquo;Tolent&rsquo;<br />
      Completion expected early May. Weather much better and some   			construction time has been caught up, but some time has been lost   			due to recent theft of recently installed electricity cables (copper   			value). The roof structure and walls are approaching completion and   			the internal works are in progress.<br />
  <br />
      ii. Lodges- Contractor &lsquo;ISG&rsquo;<br />
      A 16 week programme commencing 31st January and completion date is   			20th May. A good start has been made with the site compound fenced   			off, cabins installed, scaffolding erected, demolition of   			non-original extensions completed and some stone cleaning underway.   			A temporary access has been created 50 yds from the Lodge to assist   			users of the Park - it has been signed accordingly at both   			entrances.<br />
  <br />
      iii. Structures – Contractor &lsquo;Maysand&rsquo;<br />
      The scope of works, for this contractor, includes the restoration of   			the Clock Tower, Boer War memorial, the monkey shelter (Southern   			Timber Shelter) and Play Area Shelter. Works commence on the 14th   			March; completion date and programme are not known yet but probably   			about 12 weeks.<br />
  <br />
      iv. Play Area- Contractor: County Landscapes<br />
      There are some defects still to be made good and a new path linking   			gym equipment is proposed, plus removal of old play area agreed.   			Timescale is likely to be approximately four to six weeks and should   			commence on 14th March.<br />
  <br />
      v. Footpaths <br />
      Costs for footpath works are due within the next two weeks,   			following which we will be able to agree the scope of works,   			programme, finalise costs and decide which contractors will be   			involved.<br />
  <br />
      vi. Connect 2 Works<br />
      The traffic calming works and Tipkinder crossing is underway this   			week with a new cycleway across Tipkinder. Access for disabled   			drivers is possible but a bit restricted until the new access road   			through the depot is formed as part of the footpath works later in   			the summer.<br />
  <br />
      LAKE<br />
      Fish are to be returned this month. Following checks it appears that   			there has been a lot of poaching of the large carp. When the holding   			pool is partially drained it will be possible to determine how many   			large carp are left. A health check requires ten fish, so assuming   			there are only fifteen it would be better to give them away to our   			partner angling clubs and purchase a new healthy stock. This will be   			investigated.<br />
  <br />
      CAFETERIA PROCUREMENT<br />
      The Queens Park Cafeteria Services was recently advertised via the   			Councils procurement process, however, the contact was linked to   			three park sites of which CEC has received an objection. We await   			legal advice on how this will be resolved and will let the group   			know in due course. <br />
      The Parks Manager has applied for a Cafeteria Licence for the sale   			of alcohol and to utilise the venue for entertainment to increase   			opportunities to maximise footfall through events, functions and   			refreshment sales. Maximum opening hours the cafeteria could   			potentially operate is between 8am – 2am with alcohol and hot food   			sales up to 1am -- again to facilitate the venue fully for functions   			and events. We will invite the successful contractor to introduce   			themselves to a future Friends meeting once the contract details are   			confirmed.<br />
  <br />
      POTENTIAL RE-OPENING EVENT<br />
      No Palace confirmation has been received. Therefore, it is proposed   			to plan for the <br />
      re-opening possibly on the second Saturday of September. This will   			allow sufficient time to make the event arrangements and engage with   			the community. Also, the Park will be much closer to completion.   			Should the Palace confirm, separate arrangements for an appropriate   			event/display will need to be arranged.<br />
  <br />
      The heritage lottery visited the site to discuss the Managers   			initial pre grant application. Whilst that went well, they require   			longevity of activities to be confirmed. Given the restricted   			resources available in terms of administration we are not sure how   			practical this is. The grant application was £15k; however, some   			limited monies have been identified within the project which would   			ease the event arrangements considerably. <br />
      Key events would include a re-creation of the original procession   			which entered the Park. Already discussions are underway with local   			art workers to produce costumes with school children to recreate   			this, a marching band and fireman&rsquo;s arch echoing the event of some   			120+ years ago. The later date makes school involvement possible.   			Plus, Victorian themed side shows.... budget permitting. And,   			concluding with a pyro-show, the like of which most local residents   			would not have seen. This would be an interpretation of Crewe   			evolving from an industrial engineering town into today&rsquo;s more   			modern economy. We await to confirm availability of this   			performance.<br />

      9.0 AOB<br />
      Q: Is the Tipkinder Car park to be resurfaced?<br />
      A: (A. Leah) no money is available for resurfacing or bay marking   			etc – to undertake this project would take monies from the paths in   			the park. The problems with the TipKinder car park are problems with   			holes, rather than a need to resurface – finding filler for these   			can probably be arranged.<br />
      Park access for events and disabled drivers will change as the paths   			are completed – there will be no vehicle access via the east gate   			when the project is finished.<br />
      To the west, the new Cycleway needs soil and reseeding from the Golf   			Club area.<br />
  <br />
      Opening of south and west gates: The gates are being fabricated. The   			final costing for refurbishment of paths is greater than foreseen.   			This is partly because some of the paths were not originally   			well-constructed. It is envisaged that the paths project will enable   			a link norh –south and east –west through the park and across the   			bridges. Other paths might have to be given a temporary surface   			until further funding is available.<br />
  <br />
      Q: When will the Games Pavilion be completed? The season begins on   			April 1st.<br />
      A: It is scheduled for completion by 1st May and won&rsquo;t be far off   			completion when the season starts. Temporary facilities will be   			confirmed in the interim – Elaine to arrange.<br />
  <br />
      Q: When will there be access to Burma Star Island and use of that   			bridge? Could the barriers be removed so that the bridge can be used   			as a viewing platform?<br />
      A: It will be linked to the forthcoming footpath project and take   			into account changing levels and gradients, plus some changes to   			footpath layout. The viewing platform suggestion will be considered.<br />
  <br />
      Q: Will the large roof space area of the new pavilion be utilised?<br />
      A: No. As in the original plans, the beams will remain exposed and   			the open-plan design will allow a clear vista.<br />
  <br />
      Q: Is the double swing in the new playground dangerous?<br />
      A: It is in accordance with required health and safety standards –   			some signs about suitable age group of users and usage will be   			considered.<br />
  <br />
      Q: The gym equipment area gets very muddy – wht can be done about   			this?<br />
      A: A path link is to be added and drainage improved.<br />
  <br />
      Q: What are the two Lodge houses to be used for?<br />
      A: They will be used for offices, staff facilities and as a   			community facility with approved and signed disabled access and   			toilets.<br />
  <br />
      Q: What sort of re-opening event will there be? Will it be in place   			of the Carnival?<br />
      A: The event is no longer contingent on a royal visit (see Chair&rsquo;s   			notes above) but requires an amount of funding that is not currently   			available. Nigel Irlam suggested approaching the townspeople for   			support by staging publicity events in the town centres.<br />
      It was pointed out that the Friends Group, as organisers, is not a   			registered Charity.<br />
  <br />
      It was also suggested that a plan of action for the publicity be put   			to the Town Centre Manager by Nigel.<br />
      There was a further suggestion that the opening event should involve   			local community groups and reflect the multi-cultural society we   			live in.<br />
      With regards to Carnival, CEC has not approved any event budget. The   			re-opeing event is a separate issue and has only £10k allocated at   			this time with a further £5k contributed form Crewe Trustees.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
      Q: How will children and young people be involved?<br />
      A: Elaine referred to the success of the Christmas Lantern   			Procession. If the opening goes ahead in September (?) there will be   			a Victorian Parade with multi-generational involvement. School-based   			workshops could begin in June. If there is to be a parade, a route   			will have to be agreed – all ideas are welcome!<br />
      AOB Derek Morgan : presented the Friends Group with a cheque for   			£85, this being half the proceeds of Santa&rsquo;s Grotto in the Park, as   			agreed. He was thanked for all his work on this project.<br />

      Welcome to the first Friends Group AGM by Derek Morgan_<br />
      Chairperson's Report<br />
      Derek Morgan presented his report for the year.<br />
      It is now 12 months since the Friends group was constitutionalised.   			The committee has worked hard in many areas to try and improve the   			presentation, atmosphere and peoples knowledge regarding the Queens   			Park project.<br />
      Appreciation to the Project Officer, Allan Leah, for pushing   			forward. In summary progressed works so far are -<br />
      The Bandstand has been completed along with the Burma Star island,   			the lake has had the retaining walls rebuilt and is looking good.   			The lake itself was water tested and after a hiccup was filled and   			holds water. It is a good sight to see the lake in its early stages   			completed. It is just a matter of time whilst we wait for all the   			planting to take hold, and show us a spectacular finished product.<br />
      All the bridges were replaced and what a feat of engineering that   			was.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      The children's play area and the wellbeing area have been completed   			for all ages to enjoy; there are some minor details to attend to   			most importantly protection to stop children gaining access to the   			main road way.<br />
      The latest projects namely the Games Pavilion and the Cafe Pavilion   			are now well underway. The stone work on the Cafe is incredible and   			will reflect times gone by. I am sure we are all waiting to see the   			Games Pavilion reflecting a similar standard.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      I must give credit to our gardeners who over the last few weeks have   			been uplifting all the summer plants ready for the winter bulbs and   			plants.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      On several visits to the park I have spoken with the team and with   			Tolent and all are upbeat about the progress being made.<br />
      The friends group have, since December 09, been very active with   			several functions. Thanks to Elaine Dodd the Parks Manager we were   			able to do fund raising at our first</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Friend of Queens Park Minutes: Wednesday 20™ October 2010 page 1<br />
      attempt: the Christmas Carol concert in the Park, involving local   			children in a lantern parade.. It is hoped that this will become an   			annual event that will grow with the cooperation of local schools   			and other groups. The Friends group also had a planting day, thanks   			to Adrian Birchall from the Park, where local people and children   			came along and learnt a bit about planting; each child was able to   			take home the tool they had used to plant their own flowers. Again   			we had a fund raising stall too.</p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify"> At the Starquest event we again did fund   			raising with two stalls; on one was the bird boxes made by Adrian   			and appreciation to him again for that and also for his day in July   			when he enlightened any visitor interested on the Joys of your own   			Bird Box. On Carnival day the Friends were fundraising again. In   			summary, over the last 12months, the group has been keenly active.   			It would be unkind of me not to mention our youth representative,   			Daniel Prime, who along with his family has made a great effort to   			attend most functions, that is meetings and fund raising, again   			thank you. I personally would like to thank all the members and   			other volunteers, who made the effort to help at any of the events,   			also the park wardens for their contribution to the group and hope   			that through the coming years this group will produce some   			outstanding contributions to this Jewel in Crewe's Crown.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      4 Secretary's Report Sheila Blackburn presented her report for the   			year. Agendas and minutes have been prepared for seven meetings and   			circulated via the Park Office. Data bases have been established   			for: Friends wishing to receive minutes and agendas War Veterans   			Group Charities to be contacted to take part in events   			Correspondence: Charities for Starquest 29 letter asking for   			sponsorship for the Christmas Celebration 2010 Letter to Rev Clapham   			asking him to lead the Christmas Celebration Letters received to   			date There have been three replies to the request for sponsorship.   			Mornflake Oats, Bentley Motors and Argos are unable to support due   			to ongoing charity commitments. Information Boards From September,   			posters and signs have been prepared for both boards in the Park.   			Thanks My personal thanks are to Elaine for her patience and support   			over the year as I have learned my role as Secretary. I also thank   			all those who have supported the Group's fundraising and especially   			Daniel and Lisa Prime who have attended every event over the past   			year. Ahead As a committee we will be looking at our further   			involvement in the development of the<br />

Paper work administered to establish the account-Cheque book   			received. Signed signatories for cheques is myself and the Secretary   			jointly. Current funds are £523.70, which includes a donation from   			Crewe Lions and proceeds from fund-raising events. • . i Bank   			statements have now been ordered quarterly.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      6 Fund Raising Officer's Report Nigel Irlam presented his report for   			the year: I believe my role will develop and extend as the Park is   			opened and that this will reflect my ideas for large scale events in   			the Park. I will be putting these ideas to the committee in due   			course, but can say that they include small merchandising and events   			such as a Wedding Fair.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      7 Election of Officers Chairperson: Derek Morgan was nominated and   			seconded. He was voted in as Chairperson and accepted. Derek then   			suggested an amendment to the constitution and asked attendees to   			consider electing officers for a period of three years to ensure   			continuity. This does not exclude Officers from a vote of   			no-confidence where they may lose their position. Officers of:   			Chairperson: Derek Morgan Secretary: Sheila Blackburn Treasurer: Pam   			Minshall agreed to stand for the three year period and the motion   			was carried.

    <p>4.	 Works in Progress<br />
      Generally the project is progressing well and the park is   starting to look more like a public park than a building site. </p>
    <p>CAFÉ &amp; GAMES PAVILLION<br />
      The building works are now evident above ground, for the   public to see as the structure of the Cafe and Games buildings are    emerging. The slabs and groundwork's for both buildings will be   completed within the next 2 weeks. The steel for the chimneys of the   main pavilion will be erected this week which will give a good   impression to the public of the height of this building. The retaining   wall at the rear of the main pavilion is complete.<br />
      The blockwork for both buildings is being constructed and   the red sandstone sample panels will be built this week to enable   commencement of the sandstone walls next week assuming they are approved   by the architect.</p>
    <p>LODGES<br />
      The works to the Lodges are being tendered and planning   permission has just been granted for this work. Lost Art (The   ex-Bandstand Contractors) have been asked to advise on the approach and   cost implications of restoring the Victorian play area shelter and the   timber shelter on the south side of the lake. </p>
    <p>SOIL MOUND ; What Is It For…<br />
      You will remember that we reported that the support wall on   the western side of the Park was filing and would have eventually   collapsed, maybe with part of the roadway, into the Park.  Also, there   is a requirement to level off the sever footpath drop to aid wheelchairs   and pushchairs. </p>
    <p>You may have noted that County Landscapes have been   commissioned to regrade the spoil on the North West boundary of the park   and regrade and cultivate and grass seed the western events areas. This   work also requires capping off a manhole and raising 2 manholes and is   within the scope of the works agreed with County Landscapes which should   be completed by the end of the month. </p>
    <p>Our own Parks team have also soiled and re-seeded the   TipKinder inlet end of the lake edges in readiness of opening up the   pathway and will complete similar works to the northern side of the lake   pathway this month.  Herris fencing has been moved back or changed to   open out the views and looks much better as this works progresses. </p>
    <p>RAILINGS / GATES<br />
      The same contractor, County Landscapes, has also been asked   to progress the completion of the new gates and are finishing small   sections of railings. Footpath works will be the next package to be   tendered.</p>
    <p>Playground<br />
      The new play area has been successfully completed and is   proving to be very popular. Assuming Wren approve the funding bid for   the 2nd phase Buccaneer Towers this work will commence in the autumn.   Planning permission is anticipated by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Lake Waters ; Inlet and Outlet Mechanisms<br />
      Jim Mitchell of Heritage Engineering has been commissioned   to advise on and implement repairs and improvements to the inlet and   outlet mechanisms of the lake.</p>
    <p>7.	 Volunteers<br />
      Many thanks for our kind volunteers ; Mr &amp; Mrs Curran,   Mo Grant, Andrew Flood, Mrs Prime, Jules, plus some of the Committee,   Sheila, Daniel, Pam, Dorothy Elaine and myself. </p>
    <p>8.	Potential Re-Opening Event<br />
      Two Grant Applications are being prepared to apply for   funding to support the above event, plus a growth item from Cheshire   East Council is to be considered.</p>
    <p>It is hoped the Arts Council and Crewe Trustees will   support the project to be able to provide investment to stage an event   worthy of the projects completion.</p>
    <p>Elaine and Allan are to present to the Crewe Trustees later   this month and are hopeful of their support.  The Arts Application is   still being compiled as more information has been requested.<br />
      The event will not unfortunately happen unless additional funding is sourced.<br />
      It is envisaged this will be staged instead of Carnival during 2011.</p>

Water levels to be monitored and water quantities   extracted require formal notification to Env Agency. A meeting with the   architect and Tolent's site manager will take place within the next 2   weeks to consider which areas of the site can be returned to the Council   and opened up to the public.</p>
    <p>Embankment remodeling is ongoing.<br />
      Foul drain diversion continues.<br />
      Landing Stage edge completed May 2010.<br />
      Landing stage - supply of power and improved Kiosk being investigated.<br />
      Barley straw bales are to be placed in the lake, this month, to assist in preventing algal bloom.</p>
    <p>3. Bandstand<br />
      Works substantial complete, final inspection required to   enable Practical Completion. Electricians to relocate existing feeder   pillar.</p>
    <p>4. East &amp; West Lodges<br />
      Planning &amp; listed Building consent application have been   made. Detail design ongoing to be followed by procurement</p>
    <p>5. Clock Tower, Boer War Memorial<br />
      Detail design &amp; procurement to follow the lodges.</p>
    <p>6. Shelters<br />
      Outline proposals being prepared by consultants for   consideration by CEC. Family has requested tribute plaque to originator   of 'monkey' shelter once completed.</p>
    <p>7. Coronation Walk Valley<br />
      Bertram Hyde is currently preparing a 'mini master plan' for these works in collaboration with CEC.</p>
    <p>8. Hard Landscaping<br />
      Design &amp; procurement process is ongoing. Cost is still an issue.<br />
      Friends Queens Park<br />
      The C&amp;N Lions have confirmed sponsorship of a memorial   garden and wish to be involved in the design and selection of materials   in partnership with the consultants.</p>
    <p>9. Footpaths<br />
      Tolent ground works package is all but finalized, and we   await for the next set of ground works ie footpaths. Expressions of   interest are due back on the 22nd of June, following which a tender list   will be put together to enable works to commence in the summer, in a   phased way taking account of the building works.</p>
    <p>10. Play Area<br />
      County Landscape Developments have been appointed for the   works; most of the equipment is to be supplied by Wicksteed. Inclusive   element approved by ex-Mayor C&amp;NBC which has been kindly funded by   earlier fund raising activities. Commencing on site mid June with   completion anticipated by the end of July.<br />
      10.1   Tree information Note:<br />
      A detailed inspection by the Council's arboriculturist of   trees which adjoin the play area has revealed some serious defects.<br />
      Although these trees are not dangerous in the short term the   restoration team considers that they are best dealt with before the new   play area is constructed to avoid the potential risk of branches or in   some cases whole trees failing when the new equipment is installed and   the new play area is attracting larger numbers of children. The best   trees will be retained and there will be sufficient tree cover to   provide dappled shade for the informal play and picnic areas we intend   to provide as a part of the design.</p>
    <p>11. Pavilions<br />
      Tolent have been appointed to undertake the works,   commencement anticipated for the 14th June with completion mid Feb 2011.<br />
      Further earth moving will be required following demolition works.<br />
      Games pavilion knocked down 17th &amp; 18,h June 2010.   Temporary facilities and toilet have been hired to accommodate Bowling   Club and users.<br />
      A Bat survey has been undertaken to determine if there were   roosting Bats in the Main Pavilion. The results were negative enabling   the demolition to commence.<br />
      At peak time a mobile cater will be on-site.</p>
    <p>12.Management &amp; Maintenance Plan<br />
      Maintenance plans continue to be developed to ensure future   budgets are sufficiently to resource enhanced future ground maintenance   schedules.</p>
    <p>13.Cost Issues<br />
      The tender returns for the Pavilion works, is likely to   compromise the overall cost by in the order of £120,000. This issue   needs to be resolved with CEC and consultants as there is no possibility   of additional budget provision. Possible ways of dealing with this are   to use remaining contingency or inflation budgets, omit or reduce the   specification for some works or carry out some works as maintenance   rather than as part of the capital programme.</p>
    <p>14. Client Issues<br />
      13.1 Existing Depot Building - consideration to be given to   demolition of the existing building following relocation of the staff to   the East Lodge and provision of smaller steel storage units discreetly   placed in the depot' area<br />
      13.2 Angling - Consideration being given to progressing   management with an Association' of local angling clubs, and also a   review needs to be undertaken regarding the availability offish to   restock the Lake and suitable timing.<br />
      13.3 Sustrans connect 2 contractor, William Pye have their   compound sited on the KGV Car Park and are likely to be there for   approximately 3 months. Works around the south west quadrant of the park   will improve the setting to the park and will be done early in their   programme.</p>
    <p>EVENTS<br />
      The C&amp;N Lions have kindly donated £500 for events. Plus   £100 cash prize for Star Quest. Appreciation to the volunteers, all of   whom weren't needed for the<br />
      first event, however, will be contacted regarding the next fund raising Friends day.<br />

      The Chairperson of the Friends Group, Derek Morgan, presented his report:<br />
      Tolent Works: <br />
      All lake edge works complete minor snagging in progress.                                      Coronation Bridge completed and handed   over.                                                                       Inlet Bridge now handed over.                                                                                                   Burma Star   bridges, a matching set, now complete. Minor snagging in progress          All snagging to be complete by Friday 7th May. <br />
      Broadwalk Bridge works complete. Minor snagging in progress   including re-painting the main arch. The tarmac footpath link at either   end of the bridge is to be extended. On the East side of the bridge it   will be extended to meet up with the existing path.   The sequence to   install this bridge has been rather technical and has included: <br />
      1. A 150 tonne crane was brought onto site to lift the arch   off the back of the wagon and to lift the shoes into place to carry the   arch.                                                                         2. A 200 tonne crane was then brought onto site to lift the arch   into place. This was a complex operation, firstly due to the weight as   the arch weighed over 12 tonne and secondly because the way the arch was   designed the shoes had to be fitted before the arch was lifted into   place. This meant that there was no tolerance at all when the arch was   lifted into place.                                                                                                                   The arch was   approx 28 metres long and we had 1 mm to play with on each pin.   Thankfully the designers, the manufactures off site, the engineers and   labour who carried out the works on site, had done a perfect job and the   arch fitted to perfection. <br />
      3. A 300 tonne crane was then brought onto site then to lift   in the first 2 sections, the heaviest being 20 tonnes. The next day a   25 tonne crane was then brought in to lift in place the balustrades and   the infill beams. It also was used for lifting the decking onto the   bridge for installing. <br />
      4. We then brought a 350 tonne crane onto site to lift the   remaining sections into the place. This was a complex operation due to   the distance, the trees which were in the vicinity of the crane lift and   also the weight. To overcome this we had to get a structural engineer   to design the crane platform. To get over the tree problem we had to   install a track-way road and platform which is in fact a floating   platform which spreads the load over the whole platform rather than just   point loading a small area. Each jack under load was taking a load of   110 tonnes which meant the crane platform in its present state would not   stand up to the pressure and would collapse. <br />
      Due to the distance the crane was lifting a counter balance   of 140 tonne was put on the back of the crane. The radius the crane was   lifting in at was 50 metres so if there were no counter balances the   crane would have tipped up under the weight at its maximum radius.                                                                                                                                            The final   sections of the bridge were lifted into place in one day with no   hitches. <br />
      5. Finally a 75 tonne crane was brought in to lift the final   intermediate beams, balustrades and deck boards to complete the job.                                                                        It   then took thousands of screws which had to be pre-drilled and fix before   the bridge deck was complete.                                                                                                                      We also had to hold several planning meetings to plan how each element   of works would be done and also to work out the potential risks involved   and on the whole the job went OK barring a few minor snags with the   operation. <br />
      As you have heard the installation of the Broadwalk bridge   was a highly complex operation which was brought to a successful   conclusion. <br />
      Tolent - Extra Work Awarded. <br />
      1. Pump and tank order placed to discharge foul from toilets   and cafe. This will allow manhole rings and drainage pipes to be   removed from in front of the Coronation Bridge. The tank is on a 10 day   delivery period. <br />
      2. Removal of the old viewing platform beside the Coronation   Bridge.                                The area is being re-configured.   This element of work will tie in with the installation of the foul   pumping main <br />
      3. Removal of the existing jetties and timber facia on the   boat landing stage .These are in the process of being removed. A new   Ekki timber fender is being installed to the metal trench sheets 500mm   deep and 150mm wide. This timber is ordered and on a 2 week delivery as   it is coming into the country through Holland. <br />
      4. Extra landscaping works being carried out to the South   lake edge around the Bridge. This work should be complete by Friday   night. <br />
      6.  Bandstand ; AL                                                                                                                         The bandstand is in the final stages of being handed over to Cheshire   East Council.  The whole project has been successfully completed and   certain historical features have been included and improved upon in its   refurbishment. The works are a credit to the craftsman who are involved   and employed by Lost Art the contractor. The company is to be considered   for two further refurbishments, namely the structure on the south side   of the lake and the playground shelter which will be incorporated into   the new playground.<br />
      AL also discussed the possible opening of the Broadwalk   Bridge as a viewing platform and described the landscaping of the   valley, with dramatic rockery effects, the opening up of the stream and   access via steps and a gradual slope.<br />
      7.  WREN Bids - AL                                                                                                                              Two WREN bids were submitted for the current round of   considerations. Unfortunately as Wren are supporting the Broadwalk   Bridge construction, which has yet to be finalised with final accounts   for works as works draw to their conclusion, the bids are to be   held-over until the next round in the Autumn.  These are for   improvements to the Water quality in the lake; also for a large   signature play installation and the refurbished Victorian shelter in the   new playground.  Whilst this is disappointing news for us, WREN have   assured us of their support where they can and we intend to plan so   related works will not be held up by this decision.   For instance, the   remaining play equipment will be put into place and added to by the   signature piece later in the year; this item and the shelter is likely   also to need planning permission so would not have been able to be   placed until approved anyway. Similarly, it is hoped to place a   temporary retainer in the lake to allow works around the sluice gates   even when the lake is filled - again so as not to delay works. <br />
      8.  Play Area                                                                                                                               Negotiations with a preferred supplier and installer are progressing   well and the equipment being considered is in accordance with our brief   and the wishes of Sir William Stanier School who have worked very   closely with us.  We anticipate the negotiations being concluded within   the next couple of weeks which will hopefully enable the new playground   equipment to be in use in the summer.  QP staff have met with   ex-Councillors and ex-Mayor Steven Roberts and Parish Cllr Maurice   Jones, who have agreed to fund additional items of 'all-inclusive'   equipment.  This will increase the budget to a total of £165,400. The   bid Allan has already told you about (above)  includes potential support   funding for the existing shelter, which could be refurbished and used   as a focal point and  meeting place in the new scheme, and also allow   for a Buccaneer Towers 6m high installation which will be carried out in   the Autumn, subject to grant approval. </p>
    <p>9. New Building package <br />
      This is about to be awarded to the successful tenderer and   details will be released at any time now.  To remind you works include:                                                                                               The Depot ; will include staff parking, skips and a   designated entrance for large vehicles that will not be close to   dedicated pedestrian paths. It will be edged by a hedging screen. <br />
      A new Cafe / Pavilion ; This will consist of two solid   sandstone end parts with a glazed central section. Materials for the   construction will reflect the front entrance buildings (as above). The   original pavilion has provided a reference point for the new pavilion   with its raised plinth, glazed central area and two end chimneys.                                                                                A   replacement Bowling pavilion ; This includes an integral toilet with   independent access, and a mower store to assist the maintenance staff.</p>

The Friends will be specifically involved in three dates:                                                                      13 June   Planting Day ; tombola stall                                                                                            25 July ; Star Quest and   Charity Day ; to assist with entries and fund raising                          5 Dec ; Lantern Parade ; marshalling procession and fund raising <br />
      To repeat my request at the last meeting..... The Friends   need to raise their own funds to support and various events, with monies   ploughed back into the Park.  In addition to committee members, we have   received just 2 volunteers to help us - thank you to ex-Councillor   Maureen Grant and our new Youth Representative Daniel Prime.  More   volunteers would be appreciated and we invite you all to become   involved.  Please let Elaine know if you can help us (Tel.  537896). </p>

      11  Other Matters<br />
      Car Parks - the initial design work for both car parks   including the crossing from Tipkinder to the east entrance to the park   and traffic calming on the highway has been completed by the design   team. However, Phil Sherratt has instructed the design team to take it   no further as the car parks are outside the park and these car parks   have to be considered as a part of a Borough Wide Car Parking Strategy.   The legacy fund of £200,000 allocated by CNBC for the car parks is to be   used as a contingency budget for the building works package.  Cllr   Cartlidge is keen to action this item and is helping us to push it   forward; we will let you know more once we know the situation. <br />
      Footpaths ; The footpaths will be phased, with the first   major section - being the one adjacent to the play area and the eastern   entrance - possibly incorporated within that package of work. The second   phase will be the footpaths to the south of the lake. This work will be   one of the next work packages to be tendered. <br />
      Contracts / Procurement                                                                                                                                           The latest round of procurements has now been   discussed with the procurement team and contractors have been asked to   express interest in the Lodges with an end of May return date for the   questionnaires.  The Lodges are to be brought back to QP usage. <br />
      West Lodge ; will become a staff / community building with   first floor offices and ground floor areas for public use, including   meetings, parties, and memorabilia lounge etc.<br />
      East Lodge - will be used by maintenance staff ; there will   be ground floor storage and training facilities.                                                                                                                                Early June re selection of contractors for   Footpaths ; although some may happen sooner, e.g. those around and   associated with the playground area.

      A	The architects do not want to keep adding tasks onto the   Tolent works and advise use of landscape / civil engineering contractors   for the footpath refurbishments.  It is possible that Tolent will be   involved in the new buildings.<br />
      Q	Could the refurbishment of the south lake side shelter include a historical note or plaque to the family?<br />
      A	This will be part of the refurbishment.<br />
      Q	Will there be any fountains in the lake?<br />
      A	The lake is to be aerated by a specific system and by planting.<br />
      Q	Will the Aberdeen granite in Coronation Walk be preserved?<br />
      A	It will probably be re-sited and the fountains made operational again.<br />
      Q	When will the lake be re-filled?<br />
      A	This will be done in the next few weeks. Vegetation and   old bottles and debris still have to be removed. Tolent's contract   includes the testing of the lake bed to check it's watertight. Over   summer, the water level in the lake will be raised and lowered to allow   for planting and other works. All of this also has to take account of   nesting birds and the needs of other wildlife.<br />
      Q	Will there be CCTV for the new play area?<br />
      A	There is no budget for this at present. There is also a   safeguarding issue of children being filmed to be taken into account.<br />
      Q	Will there be CCTV cameras to monitor the Broadwalk Bridge   ; it is very high and dangerous if children climb on it.<br />
      A	CCTV is not part of the budget, as above. Park security   includes daytime wardens and a Security Group Patrol that operates   different hours to deter vandals etc.<br />
      The Heritage Lottery requires a 10 year maintenance plan   without which the grant could be reclaimed. Cheshire East need to have   this plan in place before the handover in 2011.<br />
      Other attendees made points about reduced vandalism problems   in other parks when user groups are encouraged and the park is used   extensively ; a busy park is less attractive to trouble-makers.<br />
      Q	When will new buildings be completed<br />
      A	This is scheduled to be before Christmas 2010.<br />
      There will not be a portacabin instead of the pavilion   during the summer months and outside caterers are to be invited to offer   refreshments to park users during this period.<br />
      It was acknowledged that the Bowling Group need facilities   and these will be made available through use of the Lodge Houses.<br />
      Q	Where will Carnival 201 be held?<br />
      A	King George playing field as last year ; fireworks possible to be staged in park.<br />
      Reference was also made to a £10,000 cut in the Carnival budget for 2010.<br />
      Q	Will the Moreton Road entrance be open soon, as previously suggested?<br />
      A	AL: Possibly, with access down path to the new footbridge.   Tolent are still tidying the path but looking at the possibility of   using it before it is refurbished.<br />
      Q	Will car parking be improved?<br />
      A	Car parking on the Tipkinder side is being reviewed under   the general umbrella of car parking and be part of the ongoing   consultation process for the whole town.</p>

    <p>FRIENDS NOTES - UPDATE MARCH 2010<br />
      Items:<br />
      4.  Nomination of Youth Representative<br />
      We ask for nominations please.  (Dorothy to nominate Daniel   Prime who has shown much interest in the project and already been   involved in meetings and the bridge pre-visit).<br />
      Seconded by... Pam.</p>
    <p>5. Friends Chairpersons Update:<br />
      Tolent Works</p>
    <p> All lake edge works complete minor snagging in progress.</p>
    <p>Coronation Bridge completed and handed over.</p>
    <p>Inlet Bridge now handed over.</p>
    <p>Burma Star bridges, a matching set, now complete. Minor snagging in progress<br />
      All snagging to be complete by Friday 7th May.</p>
    <p>Broadwalk Bridge works complete. Minor snagging in progress   including re-painting the main arch. The tarmac footpath link at either   end of the bridge is to be extended. On the East side of the bridge it   will be extended to meet up with the existing path.</p>
    <p>The sequence to install this bridge has been rather technical and has included:</p>
    <p>1. A 150 tonne crane was brought onto site to lift the arch   off the back of the wagon and to lift the shoes into place to carry the   arch.</p>
    <p>2. A 200 tonne crane was then brought onto site to lift the   arch into place. This was a complex operation firstly due to the weight   as the arch weighed over 12 tonne and secondary the way the arch was   designed the shoes had to be fitted before the arch was lifted into   place. This meant that there was no tolerance at all when the arch was   lifted into place. </p>
    <p>The arch was something like 28 metres long and we had 1 mm   to play with on each pin. Thankfully the designers, the manufactures off   site, the engineers and labour who carried out the works on site, had   done a perfect job and the arch fitted to perfection.</p>
    <p>3. A 300 tonne crane was then brought onto site then to   lift in the first 2 sections, the heaviest being 20 tonnes. The next day   a 25 tonne crane was then brought in to lift in place the balustrades   and the infill beams. It also was used for lifting the decking onto the   bridge for installing.</p>
    <p>4. We then brought a 350 tonne crane onto site to lift the   remaining sections into the place. This was a complex operation due to   the distance, the trees which were in the vicinity of the crane lift and   also the weight. To overcome this we had to get a structural engineer   to design the crane platform. To get over the tree problem we had to   install a track-way road and platform which is in fact a floating   platform which spreads the load over the whole platform rather than just   point loading a small area. Each jack under load was taking a load of   110 tonnes through each jack who meant the crane platform in its present   state would not stand up to the pressure and would collapse.</p>
    <p>Due to the distance the crane was lifting a counter balance   of 140 tonne was put on the back of the crane. The radius the crane was   lifting in at was 50 metres so if there were no counter balances the   crane would have tipped up under the weight at its maximum radius.</p>
    <p>The final sections of the bridge were lifted into place in one day with no hitches.</p>
    <p>5. Finally a 75 tonne crane was brought in to lift the   final intermediate beams, balustrades and deck boards to complete the   job.</p>
    <p> It then took thousands of screws which had to be pre-drilled and fix before the bridge deck was complete.</p>
    <p> We also had to hold several planning meetings to plan how   each element of works would be done and also to work out the potential   risks involved and on the whole the job went OK barring a few minor   snags with the operation.</p>
    <p> As you have heard the installation of the Broadwalk bridge   was a highly complex operation which was brought to a successful   conclusion.<br />
    </p>
    <p> <br />
      Tolent - Extra Work Awarded.</p>
    <p>1. Pump and tank order placed to discharge foul from   toilets and cafe. This will allow manhole rings and drainage pipes to be   removed from in front of the Coronation Bridge. The tank is on a 10 day   delivery period.</p>
    <p>2. Removal of the old viewing platform beside the Coronation Bridge.<br />
      This area is being re-configured. This element of work will tie in with the installation of the foul pumping main</p>
    <p>3. Removal of the existing jetties and timber facia on the   boat landing stage .These are in the process of being removed. A new   Ekki timber fender is being installed to the metal trench sheets 500mm   deep and 150mm wide. This timber is ordered and on a 2 week delivery as   it is coming into the country through Holland.</p>
    <p>4. Extra landscaping works being carried out to the South   lake edge around the Bridge. This work should be complete by Friday   night.</p>
    <p>6.  Bandstand - AL<br />
      The bandstand is in the final stages of being handed over to   Cheshire East Council.  The whole project has been successfully   completed and certain historical features have been included and   improved upon in its refurbishment. The works are a credit to the   craftsman who are involved and employed by Lost Art the contractor.</p>
    <p>7.  WREN Bids - AL<br />
      Verbal Progress report from Allan Leah.  Two WREN bids were   submitted for the current round of considerations, unfortunately as Wren   are supporting the Broadwalk Bridge construction, which has yet to be   finalised with final accounts for works as works draw to their   conclusion, the bids are to be held-over until the next round in the   Autumn.  These are for improvements to the Water quality in the lake;   also for a large signature piece in the playground.  Whilst this is   disappointing news for us, WREN have assure us of their support where   they can and we intend to plan so related works will not be held up by   this decision. </p>
    <p>For instance the remaining play equipment will be put into   place an added to by the signature piece later in the year, this item is   likely also to need planning permission so would not have been able to   be placed until approved anyway. Similarly, it is hoped to place a   temporary retainer in the lake to allow works around the sluice gates   even when the lake is filled.  Again so as not to delay works. <br />
      8.	 Play Area<br />
      Negotiations with a preferred supplier and installer are   progressing well and the equipment being considered is in accordance   with our brief and the wishes of Sir William Stanier School who have   worked very closely with us.  We anticipate the negotiations being   concluded within the next couple of weeks which will hopefully enable   the new playground equipment to be in use in the summer.  QP staff have   met with ex-Councillors and ex-Mayor Steven Roberts and Pairsh Cllr   Maurice Jones, who  have agreed to fund additional items of   'all-inclusive' equipment.  This will  increase the budget to a total of   £165,400. The bid Allan has already told you about includes potential   support funding for the existing shelter, which could be refurbished and   used as a focal point and  meeting place in the new scheme, plus also   allow for a Buccaneer Towers 6m high installation which will be carried   out in the Autumn, subject to grant approval will be mid October.</p>
    <p>9.  New Building package <br />
      This is just about to be awarded to the successful tenderer   and details will be released at any time now.  To remind you works   include:</p>
    <p>The Depot ; will include staff parking, skips and a   designated entrance for large vehicles that will not be close to   dedicated pedestrian paths. It will be edged by a hedging screen.<br />
      A new Cafe / Pavilion ; which will consist of two solid   sandstone end parts with a glazed central section. Materials for the   construction will reflect the front entrance buildings (as above). The   original pavilion has provided a reference point for the new pavilion   with its raised plinth, glazed central area and two end chimneys. <br />
      A replacement Bowling pavilion ; This includes an integral   toilet with independent access, and a mower store to assist the   maintenance staff.<br />
      10	 Events Posters were distributed at the last meeting ;   please post one up where you can ; your local shop, Post Office, works   notice board, anything will help us please. </p>
    <p>The Friends are also getting particularly involved in three dates:<br />
      13 June Planting Day ; tombola stall<br />
      25 July ; Star Quest and Charity Day ; to assist with entries and fund raising<br />
      5 Dec ; Lantern Parade ; marshalling procession and fund raising</p>
    <p>To repeat my request at the last meeting..... The Friends   need to raise their own funds to support and vary events, with monies   ploughed back into the Park.  We have received just 2 volunteers to help   us that's a big thank you to ex-Councillor Maureen grant and our new   Youth Representative Daniel Prime.  More volunteers would be appreciated   and we invite you all to become involved.  Please let Elaine know if   you can contribute any time to help us (Tel.  537896). </p>
    <p>11  Other Matters<br />
      1.	Car Parks - the initial design work for both car parks   including the crossing from Tipkinder to the east entrance to the park   and traffic calming on the highway has been completed by the design   team. However, Phil Sherratt has instructed the design team to take it   no further as the car parks are outside the park and these car parks   have to be considered as a part of a Borough Wide Car Parking Strategy.   The legacy fund of £200,000 allocated by CNBC for the car parks is to be   used as a contingency budget for the building works package.  Cllr   Cartlidge is keen to action this item and is helping us to push it   forward, we will let you know more once we know the situation. <br />
      2.	Footpaths ; The footpaths will be phased, with the first   major section - being the one adjacent to the play area and the eastern   entrance - possibly incorporated within that package of work. The second   phase will be the footpaths to the south of the lake. This work will be   one of the next work packages to be tendered.</p>
    <p>11 Cont'd  Other matters from Allan Leah Projects Office<br />
      The latest round of Contracts have now been placed to happen:<br />
      -	End May re Lodges.  The Lodges which are to be brought back to QP usage.<br />
      West Lodge House ; will become a staff / community building   with first floor offices and ground floor areas for public use,   including meetings, parties, and memorabilia lounge etc.<br />
      East Lodge - will be used by maintenance staff ; there will be ground floor storage and training facilities.</p>
    <p>-	Early June re Footpaths ; although some will happen sooner, those around and associated with the playground area.<br />
      -	End July re Boar War memorial and Clock Tower works.</p>

      4.0	Chairman's Report<br />
      The Chairperson of the Friends' Group, Derek Morgan, presented his report:<br />
      Tolent Works                                                                                                                              Tolent have been on site for 26 wks following acceptance of the   contract, and their works are almost finalised.   Progress on site is   now self evident.                                             Lake edge   preparations, gabion stone baskets and coir logs are all now almost   completed in readiness for planting up marginal plants and filling the   lake.   Tolent are expected to leave site during the week following   Easter. <br />
      The Project Manager is seeking to open up the Moreton Road   entrance and the Inlet Bridge shortly after the contractors have pulled   out of site.  This will improve access into the Park, be a welcomed   opening of public areas and improve access for those living and   accessing on the South side of the park.  However, some of the pathways,   particularly east side, will be later as they require total   reconstruction. <br />
      An additional small works package will soon be put out for   quotations,  - this is for the landing stage works and to scrape clean   the bottom of the lake bed finally, prior to it being filled, improve   the access levels to the south Burma Star Bridge and to install a   pumping station for the foul drainage from the café, so that works in   the Coronation Walk Valley can be progressed. <br />
      5.0  Bridges<br />
      January saw the first bridge - Tipkinder inlet being placed   into position. This was shortly followed by the Coronation Walk bridge   installation, again in January, with the Burma Star bridges - a matching   pair - being positioned in March. <br />
      The Friends attended a most interesting and informative day   at the bridge fabrication works shop the day prior to the Coronation   Walk Bridge coming into the park;  it was fascinating to see it in the   workshop then on site in situ.  Also, they saw one of the huge Burma   Star bridges being transported from the works in Huddersfield, Sheffield   to be painted; it looks so much smaller now!                                                                                       One of the   Burma Star bridges was installed last week.  These bridges still require   to 'settle' as they are installed via tension, following which there   will be some bolting down and decking works to finalise.  The   installation for each of the bridges involves two processes, firstly the   initial cranage of each element into the appropriate general position,   then a second process of subsequent adjustment which may involve the use   of tension cables and / or jacks to ease the bridges into the correct   final position before all fixings bolts are installed.  The Burma Star   bridges particularly are designed to very tightly engineered tolerances   so the subsequent adjustment ensures everything is located in absolutely   the right position.   . <br />
      The Broadwalk Bridge is currently being placed with welding   works ongoing. On Monday the arch took 3 hours to come into site. As   it's 30 meters long, delivery and site access meant a complicated   delivery into the Park.  For the rest of this week it is intended to   position the supporting steel arch from Thursday onwards.  The bridge   will be put into place in 3 complete sections and a fourth section   consisting of beams to be finished off by adding the boards and hand   rail when it has been placed in position.   This Friday and Saturday   will see welding works to the shoes and deck sections, with works   continuing from Monday on the decks.  The joiner will finish most of his   works by a week on Thursday. <br />
  <br />
      All the bridge works are anticipated as being complete by Easter.</p>
    <p>The lake will be filled by the main summer holidays with a   testing of the water retention over a period of weeks.  Following this,   there will be some works on the sluice gates. <br />
      The initial delay reported as Tolent entered into the   contact has been almost caught-up with, this is a credit to Tolent and   we thank them for their progress.  Today there is about a 2 week delay.    Given there were 3 weeks of works stopped by the snow and inclement   weather this has been pulled back admirably. <br />
      The public have also commented on Tolent's staff   communications with them and again we thank them for their co-operation   in informing people about the works and the progress made. </p>
    <p> 6.0 Bandstand ; AL                                                                                                                             The bandstand is almost finished with the decorative star shape   in black and maroon being applied to the floor this week. The only   remaining work is the completion of stonework to the steps and some   ornamental metal castings to form shoe covers for the drainage column   outlet points. The contractor will also be asked for his advice and   recommendations in regard to the refurbishment of the old shelter near   the existing play area. It is estimated that the bandstand will be   finished by the first week after Easter.</p>
    <p><br />
      7.0 Island Planting                                                                                                                              Most of the plants for the west and east islands have been   delivered to Pyms Lane and are generally of a very high standard. The   supplier has failed to deliver a small number of the bulbs and   herbaceous plants and as soon as this has been resolved the gardeners   will begin the planting work. </p>
    <p><br />
      8.0 WREN Bids ; AL                                                                                                                     Additional Wren bids have been prepared to support the following works:                                  Lake Water aeration system and   improvements to inlet and outlet mechanisms                 Play Area   2nd Phase at the end of the summer - Outdoor /Gym and possibly   installations over 4m high. </p>
    <p><br />
      34 contractors initially expressed an interest with this   contract.  The disabled requirement has yet to be confirmed from the   consultation with the additional funding sourced from an ex-C&amp;NBC   Mayor. <br />
      The project will take 3 forms, appealing to all age ranges.    Toddler Equipment, Youth Equipment and Equipment for All Ages i.e.   Outdoor Gym style.  Some works may be subject to further external   funding which the Project Officer is pursuing. <br />
      Five contractors are pricing this work and Tenders are due   back on the 6th April and will be opened on the day of return. <br />
      Two WREN bids is the maximum that can be applied for during   any one bidding period and we already have one 'live'  for the Broadwalk   Bridge which should shortly be completed as works end. </p>
    <p><br />
      9.0 New Building package ; AL                                                                                                               All 3 planning applications for the building works have now been   approved.                   Tenders are due back at the end of the month   and there are 4 contractors in contention for this package. These   tenders will also be opened on the 6th April. Works are for the reduced   Depot, new Bowling Pavilion and new Cafeteria. <br />
      10.0 Events as per poster.  The friends are getting particularly involved in three dates:<br />
      13 June Planting Day ; wooden flowers.<br />
      25 July ; Star Quest and Charity  Day ; to assist with entries and tombola stall.<br />
      5 Dec ; Lantern Parade ; marshalling procession and fund raising. </p>
    <p>The Friends need to raise their own funds to support and   vary events, with monies ploughed back into the Park.  Some events were   supported last year.  Volunteers are needed to help us do this and we   would like to invite anyone to become involved.  Please let Elaine know   if you can contribute any time to help us (Tel.  537896).</p>
    <p> <br />
      11.0	AOB / Questions Raised</p>
    <p><br />
      Q:  Will the new Bowling Pavilion be used by others?<br />
      A: The new building will have external access to toilets and   will possibly be available for use in winter for, eg, hire for   children's parties.</p>
    <p>Q: When will the pathways be accessible again?<br />
      A: (and see Chair report above) The contract for new   pathways will go out to tender in early summer as per the schedule on   the information boards in the park. The southern area of the park will   be the first to be opened to the public. Throughout the park, the paths   are in different states of repair; some need completely reforming and   this will be in addition to reducing slopes and enabling access for all.   Works need to be phased because of the hard and soft landscape works   and building works which will be ongoing at the same time. </p>
    <p>Q: How long will it be before the Park is finished?<br />
      A: Heritage Lottery Fund has granted an extension of time   until May 2011 at the latest due to the Wrekin problem which caused   major delay to the programme.  However we hope that most of the HLF   funded works will be completed by the end of Dec 2010, the original   contract date. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Q: Will the aviary and menagerie be replaced?<br />
      A: This has not been decided, but it has not been ruled out   either and it is recognised that both were popular with families. It   does not form a part of the HLF funded works.</p>
    <p>Q: Can the state of the boules pitch be improved?<br />
      A: The Park Manager will look into this</p>
    <p>Q: Friends of Queens Park have been described tonight as custodians of the Park ; how does this work?<br />
      A; The Friends are people who represent the community at   large; they also raise money to put on events in the Park and to   implement new ideas so that after the refurbishment, the Park does not   &quot;stagnate&quot;. The group can also apply for grants and monies that Cheshire   East can't apply for. It has already received donations. The group can   also help to ensure that the Maintenance and management Plan is adhered   to so that the park does not go into decline in the future.</p>
    <p>Q: The refurbishment figure stands at £6.5m. Is there a figure from Cheshire East for its upkeep?<br />
      A: (Allan Leah) The maintenance of the Park document is a   crucial part of the Heritage Lottery agreement and is currently being   compiled. No figures are available at present.<br />
      It is expected that following the refurbishment the park   will be easier to maintain to a higher standard than it was in the   recent past. All of this will be documented in the Maintenance and   Management Plan.</p>
    <p>Q: When the lake was drained, thousands of pounds worth of   fish were removed. Will the contractors who did this be bringing them   back?<br />
      A: Yes, the lake will be restocked….. Fishing pegs for all,   including disabled, are to be installed, but the management arrangements   are not known as of yet </p>
    <p>Q:  Is the planting scheme (above) only for the islands?<br />
      A: No ; planting will take place throughout the Park and   will include spraying to deter geese etc eating new planting.  The   islands need to be planted before the lake is refilled and the planting   there will involve low-maintenance plants because of access. </p>
    <p>Q: Will any more trees be felled?<br />
      A: Some tree surgery is needed and self-set trees,   especially around the perimeter fencing, will have to be reviewed and   assessed.  Where trees are removed, long-term planting with more   appropriate species is always the priority. In other areas of the park,   there will be further appropriate planting including aquatic plants and   planting of specimen shrubs and trees in the valley alongside new   pathways and stonework.</p>
    <p>Q: Will Crazy Golf and Putting be restored?<br />
      A: There is no budget for either at present, but there might   be grants that will enable these activities to be restored, possibly   with ticket package deals linked to boating and/or other activities. It   is recognised that these activities were always very popular with   families and that the purpose of the Park is to offer as much variety to   the public as possible.<br />

      6.0 Chairman's Report The Chairperson of the Friends' Group, Derek   			Morgan, presented his report: a. Bandstand: Lost Art are in the   			final stages of the completion of works. Approx 80% has been   			finished as can be seen. Predictable delays to finalising stone work   			due to ground frost, completion any time now. b. New Building   			Package: Three Planning Applications have been submitted; 1. The new   			Cafeteria; 2. Bowling pavilion and 3. Depot building. Consent for   			all 3 is expected by mid March. Will probably result in closure of   			cafe sometime during the summer months, mobile catering arrangements   			will be arranged to enable a service of light refreshments. c.   			Tolent Works Tolent have been on site for 20 wks following   			acceptance of the contract. Works have focused again on lake edges   			and islands plus preparations for bridge abutments and foundations   			etc. The Inlet Bridge at the TipKinder end of the lake was installed   			on 27th January about 1.30pm. The installation of the Coronation   			Bridge will be next Wed 17th, which will be installed in 3 sections.   			Probably from mid morning on the 17th through to mid pm. on the   			18th. Then followed by the installation of the Burma Star bridges   			(x2) and then Broadwalk Bridge. 65% of the lake edge preparation   			wall works have been completed with only the West side of the island   			to finish. Approval of materials for coping stones is to be   			confirmed this week. There is some extensive work to access roads to   			be done, to support the large cranes needed to 'swing' the bridges   			into place. It's good to see that last week and this week the Park   			is a hive of activity with 19 men from Tolent on site working on the   			lake edges and bridges with 15 also remaining on site this week.   			Five men from Lost Art are working on the completion of the   			bandstand and a team of 3 park gardeners has been clearing weeds and   			overgrown vegetation from the Coronation Walk Valley in preparation   			for the next contract package. The cold weather has caused some   			delay, however the contractor is aiming to catchup as much as   			possible with bridge installations taking place almost back-to-back.   			The bridge fabricators are working very well off-site as will be   			seen by those visiting the factory in Huddersfield next Tuesday.<br />
      Filling of the lake is anticipated by the end of the summer subject   			to unknown obstacles. Work in Progress: We are all eager to see the   			Playground works commence and consultation with Sir William Stanier   			School has continued. An expression of Interest notice on the CE web   			site attracted 34 contractor responses. This has been whittled down   			to 6 potential suppliers. The disabled requirement has yet to be   			confirmed from the consultation with the additional funding sourced   			from an ex-C&amp;NBC Mayor. The project will take 3 forms, appealing to   			all age ranges. Toddler Equipment, Youth Equipment and Equipment for   			All Ages i.e. Outdoor Gym style. Some works may be subject to   			further external funding which the Project Officer is pursuing. A   			copy of the children's presentation which is being used to draw up   			the specification is available. Further funding: Additional Wren   			bids are being prepared to support further works identified: •   			Computerised irrigation system to facilitate more efficient bowling   			green maintenance • Lake Water aeration system and improvements to   			inlet and outlet mechanisms • Play Ground Outdoor /Gym and possibly   			installations over 4m high.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      7.0 Visit to CTS Bridge Fabrication Workshop at Huddersfield The   			visit will take place on 16lh February - places are still available   			on the mini bus -apply to Elaine Dodd. The Coronation Bridge is   			scheduled to be installed on 17th February from 12 noon. Please   			contact Elaine Dodd if you hope to attend.</p>

      8.0 Draft Events 2010 A copy of the proposed programme was   			circulated - the Friends Group plans to attend these events and to   			organise a number of fund raising activities</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      9.0 AOB / Questions Raised</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: Are there any plans / views for Wifi and/ or a webcam in the   			Park? A: Allan Leah will consider raising this with the architect to   			possibly incorporate into the pavilion design. Admin and costings   			will have to be considered, but any profits could go to the Friends   			Group. Elaine Dodd explained that information terminals are also   			being considered, linked to the Lodge resource centre.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: Will there be a new boat house and landing stage? A: Allan Leah   			outlined how the landing stage provision will be included in the   			pathways project. There is no boat house plan at present but some   			sort of 'housing' would be required.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: Where are the boats? A: The boats were old and had been   			repeatedly repaired / vandalised and new ones are needed; a limited   			number of new feature boats have been stored at the Pymm's Lane   			Depot.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: Can we have something like reedbeds on the lake for   			wildlife/amphibians? A: Where there are no walls round the lake   			there are to be coir rolls with gentle slopes behind (beaches),   			these are going to be planted up with mainly native species of<br />
      plants, some marginal, some bog, These types of plants like their   			roots either completely submerged or slightly drier. After a while   			they will find their own place and create a great habitat, - it will   			look like a natural lake edge you would not be able to see the   			water's edge. This will encourage lots of insects which in turn will   			encourage larger animals. If you can encourage and support the lower   			end of the food chain, the rest will follow. 1 think we're going to   			get some great wildlife in the park. (Thanks to Adrian Birchall for   			this informative reply).</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: When will the new play areas be dona? A: The bulk of the work will be   			done before the main summer holidays. This project has been brought   			forward though there are still some planning permission issues with   			structures over 4m. high; it was thought this would effect at least   			one statement piece which will be part of the project and an   			attraction in its own right.<br />

  <strong>Item 4 Friends Chairpersons Update: March 2010</strong><br />
  <br />
      Tolent Works<br />
  <br />
      Tolent have been on site for 26 wks following acceptance of the   			contract, and their works are almost at an end.<br />
  <br />
      Progress on site is now happily self evident.<br />
  <br />
      Lake edge preparations, gabion stone baskets and coir logs are all   			now almost completed in readiness for planting up marginal plants   			and filling the lake. <br />
  <br />
      So, in summary that&rsquo;s the perimeter walls, copings and top soil,   			with a &ldquo;pulling – out&rdquo; of site by Tolent anticipated in the week   			following Easter.<br />
  <br />
      The Project Manager is seeking to open up the Moreton Road entrance   			and the Inlet Bridge shortly after the contractors have pulled out   			of site. This will improve access into the Park, be a welcomed   			opening of public areas and improve access for those living and   			accessing on the South side of the park.<br />
  <br />
      An additional small works package will soon be put out for   			quotations, this is for the landing stage works and to scrape clean   			the bottom of the lake bed finally, prior to it being filled,   			improve the access levels to the south Burma Star Bridge and to   			install a pumping station for the foul drainage from the café, so   			that works in the Coronation Walk Valley can be progressed.<br />
  <br />
      January saw the first bridge - Tipkinder inlet being placed into   			position.<br />
  <br />
      This was shortly followed by the Coronation Walk bridge installation   			again in January. <br />
  <br />
      With the Burma Star bridges a matching pair being positioned in   			March. <br />
  <br />
      The Friends had a most interesting and informative day at the bridge   			fabrication works shop just the day prior to the Coronation Walk   			Bridge coming into the park; it was fascinating to see it in the   			workshop then on site in situ. <br />
      Also, we were lucky enough to see one of the huge Burma Star bridges   			being transported from the works in Huddersfield to Sheffield to be   			painted; it looks so much smaller now! <br />
  <br />
      One of the Burma Star bridges was installed just last week. These   			bridges still require to &lsquo;settle&rsquo; as installed via tension,   			following which there will be some bolting down and decking works to   			finalise.<br />
  <br />
      The Broadwalk Bridge is currently being placed with welding works   			ongoing, on Monday the arch and took 3 hours to come into site, as   			its 30 meters long delivery and site access meant a complicated   			delivery into the Park.<br />
  <br />
      For the rest of this week it is intended to position the supporting   			steel arch from Thursday onwards. The bridge will be put into place   			in 3 complete sections and a fourth section consisting of beams to   			be finished off by adding the boards and hand rail when it has been   			placed in position. <br />
  <br />
      This Friday and Saturday will see welding works to the shoes and   			deck sections, with works continuing from Monday on the decks. The   			joiner will finish most of his works by a week on Thursday.<br />
  <br />
      All the bridge works are anticipated as being complete by Easter..<br />
  <br />
      The lake will be filled by the main summer holidays with a testing   			of the water retention over a period of weeks. Following which there   			will be some works on the sluice gates.<br />
  <br />
      The initial delay reported as Tolent entered into the contact has   			been almost caught-up with, this is a credit to Tolent and we thank   			them for their progress. Today we are about 2 weeks behind. Given   			that we had 3 weeks of works stopped by the snow and inclement   			weather this has been pulled back admirably. <br />
  <br />
      The public have also commented on Tolent&rsquo;s staff communications with   			them and again we thank them for their co-operation in informing   			people about the works and the progress made.<br />
  <br />
      5. Bandstand<br />
      The bandstand is almost finished with the decorative star shape in   			black and maroon being applied to the floor this week. The only   			remaining work is the completion of stonework to the steps and some   			ornamental metal castings to form shoe covers for the drainage   			column outlet points. The contractor will also be asked for his   			advice and recommendations in regard to the refurbishment of the old   			shelter near the existing play area.<br />
  <br />
      6. Island Planting <br />
      Most of the plants for the west and east islands have been delivered   			to Pyms Lane and are generally of a very high standard. The supplier   			has failed to deliver a small number of the bulbs and herbaceous   			plants and as soon as this has been resolved the gardeners will   			begin the planting work.<br />
  <br />
      7. WREN Bids <br />
      Additional Wren bids have been prepared to support the following   			works:<br />
      • Lake Water aeration system and improvements to inlet and outlet   			mechanisms<br />
      • Play Area 2nd Phase at the end of the summer - Outdoor /Gym and   			possibly installations over 4m high.<br />
  <br />
      8. Play Area – School??? TBC? Sir William Stanier – Steve Collins <br />
      34 contractors initially expressed an interest with this contract.   			The disabled requirement has yet to be confirmed from the   			consultation with the additional funding sourced from an ex-C&amp;NBC   			Mayor. <br />
  <br />
      The project will take 3 forms, appealing to all age ranges. Toddler   			Equipment, Youth Equipment and Equipment for All Ages i.e. Outdoor   			Gym style. Some works may be subject to further external funding   			which the Project Officer is pursuing. <br />

      The meeting this time was a short one but well attended despite   				the cold weather. Matter raised were trying to get a webcam and   				Wifi for the park and the development of the play area. Most   				other things were covered by the chairmans report below<br />
  <br />
      Friends Chairpersons Update:<br />
      a. Bandstand Completion<br />
      b. &lsquo;New&rsquo; Buildings Package / Planning Consent<br />
      c. Works in Progress<br />
  <br />
      a. Bandstand:<br />
  <br />
      Lost Art are in the final stages of the completion of works.   				Approx 80% has been finished as can be seen. Predictable delays   				to finalizing stone work due to ground frost, completion any   				time now.<br />
  <br />
      b. New Building Package:<br />
  <br />
      Three Planning Applications have been submitted – 1. The new   				Cafeteria; 2. Bowling pavilion and 3. Depot building. Consent   				for all 3 is expected by mid March. Will probably result in   				closure of cafe sometime during the summer months, mobile   				catering arrangements will be arranged to enable a service of   				light refreshments.<br />
  <br />
      c. Tolent Works<br />
  <br />
      Tolent have been on site for 20 wks following acceptance of the   				contract.<br />
  <br />
      Works have focused again on lake edges and islands plus   				preparations for bridge abutments and foundations etc. <br />
  <br />
      The Inlet Bridge at the TipKinder end of the lake was installed   				on 27th January about 1.30pm. <br />
      This will be followed by the installation of the Coronation   				Bridge next Wed 17th, which will be installed in 3 sections.   				Probably from mid morning on the 17th through to mid pm. on the   				18th.<br />
  <br />
      This will be followed by the installation of the Burma Star   				bridges (x2) and the Broadwalk Bridge.<br />
  <br />
      65% of the lake edge preparation wall works have been completed   				with only the West side of the island to finish. Approval of   				materials for coping stones is to be confirmed this week.<br />
      There is some extensive work to access roads to be done, to   				support the large cranes needed to &lsquo;swing&rsquo; the bridges into   				place.<br />
  <br />
      It&rsquo;s good to see that last week and this week the Park is a hive   				of activity with 19 men from Tolent on site working on the lake   				edges and bridges with 15 also remaining on site this week. Five   				men from Lost Art are working on the completion of the bandstand   				and a team of 3 park gardeners have been clearing weeds and   				overgrown vegetation from the Coronation Walk Valley in   				preparation for the next contract package. <br />
  <br />
      The cold weather has caused some delay however the contractor is   				aiming to catch-up as much as possible with bridge installations   				taking place almost back-to-back.<br />
  <br />
      The bridge fabricators are working very well off-site as will be   				seen by those visiting the factory in Huddersfield next Tuesday.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
      Filling of the lake is anticipated by the end of the summer   				subject to unknown obstacles.<br />
  <br />
      I would like to introduce you to Dave who has kindly attended   				from Tolent Construction – the main contractors on site; should   				anyone here have any technical questions or issues they wish to   				raise. (Open to floor). Thank you Dave.<br />
  <br />
      Work in Progress:<br />
  <br />
      We are all eager to see the PG works commence and consultation   				with Sir William Stanier School has continued. An expression of   				Interest notice on the CE web site attracted 34 contractor   				responses. This has been whittled down to 6 potential suppliers.   				The disabled requirement has yet to be confirmed from the   				consultation with the additional funding sourced from an ex-C&amp;NBC   				Mayor. <br />
  <br />
      The project will take 3 forms, appealing to all age ranges.   				Toddler Equipment, Youth Equipment and Equipment for All Ages   				i.e. Outdoor Gym style. Some works may be subject to further   				external funding which the Project Officer is pursuing.<br />
  <br />
      A copy of the children&rsquo;s presentation which is being used to   				draw up the specification is available.<br />
  <br />
      Further funding:<br />
  <br />
      Additional Wren bids are being prepared to support additional   				works identified:<br />
  <br />
      • Computerised irrigation system to facilitate more efficient   				bowling green maintenance<br />
      • Lake Water aeration system and improvements to inlet and   				outlet mechanisms<br />
      • Play Ground Outdoor /Gym and possibly installations over 4m   				high.<br />
  <br />
      Item 7<br />
      Visit to Bridge Fabricators<br />
  <br />
      5 Places remain on the coach for anyone wishing to attend next   				Tuesday leaving QP Lodge at 10am. Seats will be allocated on a   				first come first served basis – does anyone here wish to attend   				please – it will be a very interesting day for all?<br />

      30 Friends Chairperson's Report Derek Morgan presented his report,   			including: Lake and Bridge Works Tolent have been on site for 11 wks   			There has been a 6 day delay due to bad weather. The Tolent site   			will close at Xmas from 18m Dec for 2 wks. Works have focused on   			lake edges and islands plus preparations for bridge abutments and   			foundations etc. </p>
    <p align="justify">The Inlet Bridge at the Tipkmder end of the lake   			is the first bridge to go in and it will arrive on site Tue / Wed   			next week, preparation works are ongoing. All Lake Inlet walls have   			been repaired and repointed. </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">Gabion baskets all around the Burma Star Island   			to be faced with stone blocks A stone sample has been agreed East   			and West Island walls have been completed but may be raised to allow   			fluctuations in water levels. Works to modify bndge abutments are   			underway.</p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify"> Broadwalk Bndge works on site for 3 days   			next week This will be the last and largest bndge to be positioned   			estimate end of Feb. Footpath links will need to go in to facilitate   			all bridges. Coronation Bridge - Completion is expected by the end   			of January - together with Burma Star Bridge. Problem areas: &gt;   			Access roads require improving.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Weather implications.  Design modifications and approvals. &gt;   			Correction of Wrekin works where required BANDSTAND Slight slippage   			of works largely due to discoveries on site and additional higher   			quality finishes which have been agreed Matching of sandstone to   			closely match the original has been very successful. A detailed   			update and explanation of how these structures are restored will be   			given by Domenic of Lost Art. The completion date will now be end of   			January 2010.</p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify"> PLAYGROUND Rocking horse and spider's web   			removed due to safety implications. An exciting consultation took   			place involving the Sir William Stanier Community School and their   			feeder school's i.e. children talking to younger children. The   			selection and design process is well underway. Additional monies via   			ex Mayor will be allocated specifically for the disabled element. A   			contractor will be selected early spring 2010. </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">COUNTY LANDSCAPES Curved railings are to be   			completed early in the New Year and the Gates will be the very last   			item due to heavy construction vehicles accessing the park to   			install the bridges. </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">EVENTING A very successful community Youth   			Christmas Lantern Procession took place last Sunday. It attracted   			approx 300 people; we were very pleased with the response Pupils of   			Pebble Brook. Monks Coppenhail. Edleston Road and Wistaston schools   			all participated</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      4.0 Presentations</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      4.1 Bandstand: presentation by Dominic of Lost Art Dominic brought   			along books, photographs and sample materials to support his   			detailed presentation about the company of Lost Art and the work of   			its skilled craftsmen on the<br />
      park bandstand. He gave a history of the building and its unique   			features, with photos to show how the bandstand is being restored   			with close attention to detail and original materials and   			appearance. Some of the work has been affected by bad weather - this   			has made the ground too wet to bring the crane back onto site to   			replace the top parts. Throughout the process conservation records   			have been kept, together with a large number of photographs. Works   			have consisted of inspections and repairs to the internal structure.   			A temporary framework was erected to protect the structure enabling   			the roof to be raised from its original columns. Wood panels and   			stonework have been removed and repaired. A total of four columns   			have been replaced, following corrosion as used as downspouts, the   			replacements now have rubber linings to protect the interior. The   			lantern and cupola, being the top portion of the bandstand, is   			probably the most spectacular and can be seen in its refurbished   			glory with a copper finish and a gold leaf terminal, this to be   			refitted as one piece on Monday (14th). Almost complete she awaits   			for works to the floor, where the finish will match that of   			yesteryear, together with the ceiling rose which again has been   			refurbished and will be painted in traditional colours similar to   			the original paint finish Works to follow to include stone work to   			copings, walls and steps during the Christmas period. The final   			phase will be the floor which will be restored with its former   			colouring.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: Will the top include a lightening conductor A: confirmed</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      5.0 New Building Review and Presentation by Ian Bright: SBS   			Architects</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      5.1 Buildings - the new buildings will uss locally resourced   			materials to glvs a &quot;family of buildings&quot;, as in the original   			structures<br />
      Lodges to be brought back to QP usage. West Lodge House - will   			become a staff / community building with first floor offices and   			ground floor areas for public use, including meetings, parties, and   			memorabilia lounge etc. East Lodge - will be used by maintenance   			staff - there will be ground floor storage and training facilities.   			Depot - will include a storage building, polytunnel. staff parking,   			skips and a designated entrance for large vehicles that will not be   			close to dedicated pedestrian paths. It will be edged by a hedging   			screen. Pavilion - will consist of two solid sandstone end parts   			with a glazed central section. Materials for the construction will   			reflect the front entrance buildings (as above). The original   			pavilion has provided a reference point for the new pavilion with   			its raised plinth, glazed central area and two end chimneys. Bowls   			pavilion - there has been little change to previous plans for this   			new building except that it now has a mower store.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      5.2 Q: What changes will be made to the Boer War Memorial? A: The   			original steps and plinth have for many years been buried under the   			existing planting round the memorial. The soil will be removed so   			that the memorial can be restored to its original presentation. </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">Q: Prior to the installation of the new   			footbridge at the eastern end of the lake, will the walls be built   			up to mask the concrete? A: Yes. using cleaned stones from Burma   			Star Island. </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">Q: Will the gable ends of the new pavilion be   			open or sealed ceilings? A: At the kitchen end and in the central   			area, the roof will be open to show the trusses At the other end,   			the toilets will have ceilings but the lobby area will be open to   			reveal the roof structure. Q: Will this open aspect incur expensive   			heating bills? A: Underfloor heating using new green technology will   			be installed to enable year round warmth. In hot weather, roof/high   			level windows will open automatically. For security, all windows   			have individual shutters ( not industrial shutters) </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">Q Would it be possible to have an upper floor in   			the pavilion? A: This has been investigated and it has been decided   			that it is not viable because of costs of access and the loss of   			ground floor usage.</p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify"> Q: Do the chimneys at either end of the   			pavilion have a use? A: Yes; They are to be used for air exchange.   			Q: Should there be a larger toilet block for events? A: It would not   			be possible to provide adequate toilets within the buildings for   			large scale events - these will have to be brought into the park as   			before. </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">Q: Where will the playground be sited? A: Two new   			playgrounds will be in the area where the glass houses stood The   			time scale for these has been brought forward to Easter 2010 because   			of some problems with the existing playground and the need to avoid   			closure. Consultations with Sir William Stanier pupils and local   			Primary Schools have provided ideas for the playgrounds. The   			playground work has become more achievable because of changes to the   			previous plans for a staff building in that area.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      Q: When will the lake be refilled and will it be stocked with fish?   			A; should be refilled at Easter time as lake edges are scheduled to   			be finished in March. Temporary paths will then be re opened for   			public use and a phased path reinstatement will take place as a parr   			of another contract package. ¦ </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">Q: Will there be boats on the lake again? A: The   			lake reinstatement has been designed to allow for boating on the   			eastern half but no decision has been made formally by the Council   			yet.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br />
      5.3 General programme of Works: Building plans will be submitted   			before Christmas Tenders will be invited in early 2010 Contractors   			should be on site in April / May 2010 Completion should be December   			2010</p>

  <br />
      5.2 Market Research The final questionnaire is available in hard   			copy and has appeared in the <br />
      Chronicle this week. This will contribute to the Audience   			Development Plan for the Park and will <br />
      assist any future Funding Applications. <br />
  <br />
      5.3 Albert Bertram suggested that he meets with the newly formed   			Friends Group Committee to <br />
      ensure they are familiar with all aspects of the project. The   			meeting will take place in the West <br />
      Lodge meeting room at a date to be arranged. <br />
  <br />
      6.0 Presentation by Ian Bright: EBM Consultants: <br />
  <br />
      6.1 Bandstand Work on the bandstand is scheduled to take 20 weeks.   			Photos were shown detailing <br />
      the careful dismantling of the cast iron building that is to be   			restored using original materials. <br />
      The structure is to be rebuilt in situ, piece by piece. A temporary   			steel structure has been made <br />
      to support the roof during the restoration work and the top cupola   			has been removed for re- <br />
      coppering and hand cleaning at the workshops of the contractor: Lost   			Art. The step by step process <br />
      of restoration was explained with supporting photos. On-site   			meetings with the contractors <br />
      indicate that this many-phased process is on track for completion in   			early December.<br />
  <br />
      6.2 Retaining wall Work on the front wall was explained in detail,   			including the use of clay <br />
      from lagoons dug to hold the lake silt. Assurances were given about   			the bat population and <br />
      successful work on old pipes at the site. <br />
  <br />
      6.3 Bridges and Lake Works The new contractor, Tolent, is to take   			legal possession of the site <br />
      on 21st September with a responsibility to complete the work on   			time. The contractors are expected <br />
      to replace old signage. It is understood that the fabrication of the   			bridges is underway. The hard <br />
      and soft lake edging work was half completed by the previous   			contractor; Tolent will also <br />
      dismantle and replace walls of the islands, to prevent future   			collapse. <br />
  <br />
      7.0 Presentation by Albert Bertram: SBS Architects With reference to   			new faces at the meeting <br />
      and the newly constituted Friends Group, Albert explained in detail   			the contract between HLF and <br />
      Cheshire East, and continuous monitoring by experts concerned with   			quality, content and progress. <br />
      He referred to the size and unique features of the park which have   			contributed to a longer period <br />
      of restoration than other parks and a longer period needed for the   			programme than that of the <br />
      original build. He also explained elements of the total restoration   			that are not funded by HLF and <br />
      how the newly formed Cheshire East Council has had to revise some   			proposals as new funding has <br />
      come on line. Answering questions and observations from the floor,   			he confirmed that the <br />
      management, maintenance and community use of the park remain   			priorities.<br />
  <br />
      7.1 Lodge Houses The Lodge Houses will not be used for residential   			purposes as previously <br />
      planned. They will be modified using locally resourced materials in   			keeping with other buildings <br />
      in the park and will be used for staff facilities, meeting rooms and   			an education/community room.<br />
  <br />
      7.2 The Pavilion The new plans for the Pavilion are not yet   			complete, but will be for a one- <br />
      storey building that includes indoor and outdoor seating with   			overflow and a terraced verandah. <br />
      Space will be allocated for community groups and meetings.. Toilets   			will be accessed from inside <br />
      and outside, allowing for security after the cafe is closed.   			Building materials will match those <br />
      of the Lodge houses above so that the three buildings work together,   			as in original concepts.<br />
  <br />
      7.3 Depot facilities After discussion about the need for a dedicated   			team of people able to <br />
      design and implement soft landscaping and maintain it, Albert   			explained that there are ongoing <br />
      discussions about the Park being partly serviced from Pymm's Lane,   			with tool stores specific to <br />
      the maintenance of buildings on site. <br />
  <br />
      7.4 Bowls Pavilion The existing building will be replaced with a new   			build in line with the <br />
      other buildings on site. It will include toilets, changing   			facilities, a viewing area and a <br />
      meeting area. <br />
  <br />
      7.5 Building work dates It is envisaged that the work on buildings   			will begin in early 2010 <br />
      and be completed in 2011. Paths around the lake are expected to be   			open to the public again in <br />
      2010. <br />
  <br />
      8.0 AOB / Questions Raised <br />
  <br />
      8.1 Q: Who is the new contractor? What is known about them? What   			about their reliability? A: <br />
      Tolent. Information can be obtained by visiting their website. They   			have been financially checked <br />
      by Cheshire east and there are penalty clauses in their contract.<br />
  <br />
      Q; Does the new contractor know of the previous problems with the   			restoration programme? A: Yes. <br />
      Following walkabout sessions on site, the contractors are aware of   			previous issues. <br />
  <br />
      Q: Will there be a Project Manager on site for monitoring work? A: A   			quantity Surveyor for <br />
      Cheshire East values the work regularly and reports to the architect   			who then reports to Cheshire <br />
      East. Ian Bright of EBM Consultants is on site weekly. Q: Can the   			new contractor ask for more <br />
      money? A: The contract is a fixed price contract and therefore   			additional monies have to be <br />
      justified. <br />
  <br />
      Q: If the new Pavilion is to be on one level, how will a vista of   			the lake be achieved? A: The <br />
      vista will remain the same as levels have not been altered in the   			new design. Some trees will be <br />
      removed also (not the older protected ones). Q: Will there be a new   			Boat Hire building? A: boat <br />
      operations on the lake will resume and Cheshire East have yet to   			decide about the arrangements <br />
