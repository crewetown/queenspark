                                                  <p><strong>Coronation Valley Project Report</strong></p>
                                                  <p>The   immediate good news is the progress concerning the Coronation Valley   refurbishment. Robert Edwards from the Cheshire East Property Office,   was welcomed and introduced to the group. </p>
                                                  <p>Robert&rsquo;s report   detailed delays to the work as a result of several claims of active   badger sets in the valley. He re-iterated and confirmed the number of   visits by both Police and environmentalists, the reports that have been   presented to confirm that there is <em>no badger activity</em> in the   project area and the costs that have been incurred as a result of the   several investigations – these running to many thousands of pounds.   Robert was able to confirm in great depth the detailed reports that have   been presented and the fact that the CE Legal Department is satisfied   that all complaints have been proved fruitless and that the valley work   is legitimate and above board. </p>
                                                  <p>Elaine again advised the group of   her contacts with Wirral Badger Association who have also confirmed as   above. However, it was noted that <em>there have been some threatening messages and the resulting delays have cost around 20% of the budget.</em> Clearly, this will have an impact on the completion of the project and might necessitate new funding bids. </p>
                                                  <p>Robert   told the meeting that the water course pump is now working, a timer has   been fitted and the flow has been tested. Repairs to the stream bed   should take 2-3 weeks, but large boulders and cobbles that were part of   the original plans (available to view) might not be possible. The   planting scheme (available to view) might also be affected, though there   is a possibility that CEC has sourced additional funding for this.   Bench alcoves along the new pathway will have to be funded at a future   date, likewise the proposed bog garden. </p>
                                                  <p>The meeting thanked Robert for his attendance and the much appreciated information and update. </p>
                                                  <h1>The truth</h1>
                                                  <h5>The claims are all wrong the sett has been active for over 20 years the councils own report see <a href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2017/03/how-many-wildlife-crimes-have-cec.html">How Many Wildlife Crimes Have CEC Committed?</a></h5>
                                                  <p>shows   the sett was active members of the badger group confirmed it was active   in January The jobs was then stopped as it was illegal as there was no   licence from Natural England. The council then claim they put cameras   down and the sett was inactive very convenient. </p>
                                                  <p>But there is a   problem a Freedom of information request made to the council they   refused to provide any evidence from the cameras so did they exist?   Several people on the project stated different times that the cameras   were down. </p>
                                                  <p>This raises questions if they were there and showed no badgers why would that be. </p>
                                                  <p>Being breading season they may stay underground a long time </p>
                                                  <p>Being frightened by the work could keep them underground or worse still they could have disturbed them which is another crime </p>
                                                  <p>If the cameras didn't cover the whole area they would not show up </p>
                                                  <p>If   they didn't put any down they could say anything to move ahead with the   work which would explain why they wont supply the details, they broke   the law by not supplying the information in the given time which was a   crafty move so the job would be finished before anyone could act on the   info. </p>
                                                  <p>So they are wrongly saying there are no badgers but there   is a twist in the tail being a badger group we have access to the   greatest badger experts in the country and one came all the way from   Surrey during the work and did a survey in the proper manner ie she   sought permission obeyed all H&amp; S requirements and did the induction   needed. This unlike the one quoted above who broke into the site when   no one was there much to the annoyance of the contractors. </p>
                                                  <p>She   has over 20 years experience checking badger setts and she confirmed the   sett was being used as there was clear evidence of activity. Her   details which should be protected by the council under data protection   rules were leaked and she received abuse and threats as a result. </p>
                                                  <p>Now that raises more questions </p>
                                                  <p>Were   the other people who did the other surveys incompetent, negligent or   paid off to give false results? As a result work then started when it   shouldn't have passed the Police or Natural England if it was still in   use and therefore a crime may have been committed again. </p>
                                                  <p>One staff member made the comment the job comes first sod the badgers and this shows the councils attitude to the matter. </p>
                                                  <p>At   the above meeting they complain about the loss of budget and the   problems trying to blame everyone else but the truth is simple they were   advised many times they needed to obtain a licence for the work but   ignored this and any loss is their fault through bad management if they   had done the work in September when it was supposed to be done it   wouldn't need a licence so no one is to blame but the management of the   project the Police wouldn't have stopped the job if they had the correct   licence. They also carried out work close to other setts illegally. </p>
                                                  <p>The project has been visited by other experts with 30 year experience in badgers and there is <strong>undisputable evidence</strong> the badgers are still there in fact the whole area you can see foot   prints in the soil. There is evidence that a crude attempt to block the   sett was made with sods placed on one and another seems to have been   kicked to destroy it </p>
                                                  <p>To top it off they have now put flags down   for seats right next to the sett this shows total disrespect for any   wildlife by the council </p>

                                                  <p><strong>The council confirmed in the mail below that prior   to work starting they new that there were badgers in the area and it was   active.</strong></p>
                                                  <p>Thank you for raising your concerns but I would   like to reassure you that we share the same objective, that of   protecting the biodiversity of Queens Park. </p>
                                                  <p>Prior to this work   being undertaken the Council have undertaken an ecological impact   assessment work and this has informed the methodology by which this work   will be delivered. The assessment report made by an independent   specialist ecological consultant engaged by the Council states: </p>
                                                  <p><em>The   survey was undertaken in connection with the proposed installation of a   water pumping system and the restoration of surrounding features. The   site visit was completed on the 5th May 2016. It incorporated a walkover   of the site and a habitat assessment and survey for Badger (Meles   meles). The latter included a search for evidence of foraging activity   and sett building. (The ecologist who carried out the assessment has   over three years&rsquo; consultancy experience and is a member of the   Chartered Institute Ecology and Environmental Management). </em></p>
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p><em>The   site (as shown within the red line boundary on Figure 1) is public   parkland, which lies within an urban landscape in the town of Crewe,   East Cheshire. It is popular with dog walkers and is regularly managed,   including the mowing of grass to a very short sward. There is suitable   habitat at the site for foraging and sett building. A main sett   comprising six well-used holes, two partially-used holes and one disused   hole was found under shrub vegetation on an embankment adjacent to the   eastern site boundary (as shown on Target Note 1 on  Figure 1). Fresh   spoil, Badger hair and foraging activity was recorded in this area,   intermingled with evidence of Rabbit and Fox. A fresh latrine was also   recorded (as shown on Target Note 2 on Figure 1).</em></p>
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p><em>The   sett will not be directly impacted or disturbed by the proposed   development so long as a method statement is produced containing the   appropriate mitigation measures are implemented. Therefore, a Natural   England licence will not be required. </em></p>

                                                  <p><em>•   Contractors and machinery should not encroach on to the embankment on   the right site of the footpath where the sett is located;</em></p>
                                                  <p><em>• Digging must be done by hand in the northern section of the site up to the footbridge at the centre of the site;</em></p>
                                                  <p><em>•   Excavated trenches should be covered if left overnight or an escape   ladder should be installed to prevent entrapment of Badgers or other   local wildlife;</em></p>
                                                  <p><em>• Piles of spoil should be stored on   pallets off the ground or should be covered if left overnight and these   should be stored away from the sett; and</em></p>
                                                  <p><em>• Contractors will be briefed on the presence of Badgers prior to commencing site works.</em></p>
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p>Our   appointed contractors have taken these guidance measures into   consideration in designing the works and the operational staff on the   ground have been fully briefed on the importance of working carefully   and in accordance with the guidance.. </p>
                                                  <p>I trust this will allay   your concerns and reassure you that the Council does take the protection   of our biodiversity very seriously. </p>

                                                  <p>Still problems with the council not obeying the correct   procedure when dealing with badgers and therefore committing a criminal   wildlife crime and the Police stopped the work  first of all no work can   be done at this time of years its written in stone</p>
                                                  <p>4.  Work near active badger setts <strong>must be carried out between July and November inclusive</strong>, to avoid the disturbance of breeding female badgers. </p>
                                                  <p>in   breach of this and still committing wildlife crime in the area as large   amounts of concrete from the water fall have been moved past the sett   on the path 2 ft away the only way this could have been done is by the   use of heavy machinery ie tipper or digger  in breach of </p>
                                                  <p> 8.    Disturbances, such as loud noise or vibrations, that might agitate   badgers occupying a sett must be avoided or limited to areas well away   from the sett.  This may force badgers to stay underground due to the   noise and vibration. </p>
                                                  <p>We believe the work is in breach of Offences (Section 3 of the Act) Protection of Badgers Act 1992. </p>
                                                  <p>You   have failed  section 3 by not informing the parks badger group  who   have expressed concerns over this matter which you have ignored . </p>
                                                  <p>They are now trying to say they aren't there but this just shows the advisor <a href="http://www.badgerland.co.uk/help/en_badgers_development.pdf" target="_blank">has no knowledge of badgers</a></p>
                                                  <p>Badgers   do not hibernate but they often stay below ground for long periods in   winter, especially during very cold or wet weather. </p>
                                                  <p>Badgers mate   throughout the year but pregnancy starts around the end of November or   early December when the previously fertilised embryos implant into the   sow&rsquo;s uterus. Often only the most dominant sow in a family group will   produce cubs, usually two or three per litter. These are born   underground, usually towards the end of January or beginning of   February, emerging for the first time after about eight weeks . </p>

                                                  <p>Try   to do the work in Coronation walk has been stopped in part by the fact   they need to empty the small pond to put the pump in. The lake is so   flooded they cant empty it the problem being the sluice gates to empty   the lake was buried under the new paths last year so now they have had   to dig up the new path to find it. How do you manage to cover a big grid   with a new path? the sluice at the Tipkinder end is blocked by lots of   rubbish which wouldn't be a problem if they installed a simple net to   stop it falling in</p>

                                                  <p>The   Police attended the park on Wednesday to stop work as the council   require a licence from Natural England that they failed to obtain which   means its once again they committed a criminal wildlife crime. They   carried out a survey which they claimed was done in September but was in   fact done last May. Such a survey is a snapshot in time and useless a   year later as anything could have happened in the mean time. They were   advised by the wildlife group that they need a licence from Natural   England after last year were they nearly killed wildlife in the park    but ignored the advice. As for a lot of wildlife its now breeding season   extra precautions need to be taken to protect wildlife Natural England   wanted the Police called as its an offence not to have a license from   them. Given the problems last year why they didn't get a license seems   stupid a quick call the them could have clarified the situations and the   law could have been obeyed.   </p>
