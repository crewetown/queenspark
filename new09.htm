        STAKEHOLDER UPDATE DECEMBER 2009<br />
        <br />
        The meeting was poorly attended maybe the dark cold night   					had something to do with it.<br />
        <br />
        It was an interesting meeting with presentations by <a href="http://www.lost-art.co.uk/">Lost Arts </a>who are   					doing the Bandstand. We were shown the new design for the   					Cafe and Bowling club. Its hoped this can go before planning   					before Xmas and then tenders can be sought in the new year   					with work starting in March time.<br />
        <br />
        One exiting piece of news is that the play area has been   					brought forward due to complaints and the horse and spider   					falling apart. Designed by children it will be divided into   					two areas one for very young children and one for older   					children. Its hoped it will be ready for easter next year so   					thats good new all round and it shows the council do take   					notice of people.<br />
        <br />
        Its still hoped that the lake will be finished by March next   					year and open to the public at long last but some paths will   					have to be closed in the future for new paths to go in.<br />
        Chairmans report<br />
        <br />
        Lake and Bridge Works (Tolent Construction)<br />
        Tolent have been on site for 11 wks following acceptance of   					their tender.<br />
        There has been a 6 day delay due to bad weather.<br />
        The Tolent site will close at Xmas from 18th Dec for 2 wks.<br />
        Works have focused on lake edges and islands plus   					preparations for bridge abutments and foundations etc.<br />
        <br />
        The Inlet Bridge at the Tipkinder end of the lake is the   					first bridge to go in and it will arrive on site Tue / Wed   					next week, preparation works are ongoing.<br />
        <br />
        All Lake Inlet walls have been repaired and repointed.<br />
        Gabion baskets all around the Burma Star Island to be faced   					with stone blocks. A stone sample has been agreed.<br />
        <br />
        East and West Island walls have been completed but may be   					raised to allow fluctuations in water levels.<br />
        Works to modify bridge abutments are underway.<br />
        <br />
        Broadwalk Bridge works on site for 3 days next week. This   					will be the last and largest bridge to be positioned   					estimate end of Feb. Footpath links will need to go in to   					facilitate all bridges.<br />
        Coronation Bridge - Completion is expected by the end of   					January - together with Burma Star Bridge.<br />
        <br />
        Problem areas:<br />
        • Access roads require improving.<br />
        • Weather implications.<br />
        • Design modifications and approvals.<br />
        • Correction of Wrekin works where required.<br />
        <br />
        BANDSTAND<br />
        Slight slippage of works largely due to discoveries on site   					and additional higher quality finishes which have been   					agreed. Matching of sandstone to closely match the original   					has been very successful.<br />
        A detailed update and explanation of how these structures   					are restored will be given by Domenic of Lost Art. The   					completion date will now be end of January 2010.<br />
        NB. Ian will be providing a detailed update on the Lake and   					Bridge works and progress with the bandstand.<br />
        <br />
        PLAYGROUND<br />
        Rocking horse and spider's web removed due to safety   					implications see above.<br />
        An exciting consultation took place involving the Sir   					William Stanier Community School and their feeder school's   					i.e. children talking to younger children. The selection and   					design process is well underway. Additional monies via ex   					Mayor will be allocated specifically for the disabled   					element. A contractor will be selected early spring2010.<br />
        <br />
        COUNTY LANDSCAPES<br />
        Curved railings are to be completed early in the New Year   					and the Gates will be the very last item due to heavy   					construction vehicles accessing the park to install the   					bridges.<br />
        <br />
        EVENTING<br />
        A very successful community Youth Christmas Lantern   					Procession took place last Sunday. It attracted approx 300   					people; we were very pleased with the response. Pupils of   					Pebble Brook, Monks Coppenhall, Edleston Road and Wistaston   					schools all participated. </div>

    <h3> <a href="http://crewetown.blogspot.com/2009/11/help-needed-charles-dick.html"> Help Needed Charles Dick</a></h3>
    <p>  We have a relation of Dick, Charles who is trying to find any information on  him or any photos if you have anything please contact us</p>
    <p>Born at Broughty Ferry in 1838, he served an apprenticeship from 1854  under James How at Monifieth Foundry. After short times as a workman  in the marine-engine shops of J. &amp; G. Thomson on the Clyde and of James Jac  k &amp; Co at Liverpool, he was taken-on in the Crewe erecting shops in August  1860 after walking to that place from Liverpool in search of work.  In 1862, while a chargehand erector, he attracted the attention of young  Webb at the evening classes of the Mechanics Institute where he won a prize.  Webb brought him into the office as a temporary tracer and draughtsman, and  in 1863 he became an established member of the drawing office staff at 8s 4d [42p]  a day. He succeeded Kampf as chief draughtsman on 15 December 1871 at a salary  of £160 a year raised in steps to £225 at the end of 1874 and, as he himself wrote,  with heavy work and long hours. Under his charge were developed the designs of the  Webb Precursors, Precedents and coal engines.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>In February 1877 he was appointed manager of the signal department at Crewe; he  had manufacture, installation and maintenance in his care, with much outdoor wor  k along the line in all weathers. G. P. Neele, the LNWR traffic superintendent,  paid him compliments for his signal work in Railway Reminiscences ( 1902).</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>In February 1882 he succeeded Worsdell as works manager, though the appointment  was still styled indoor assistant. He died on 2 June 1888 of chest and kidney  complaints at the age of 50, but in essence he was worn out by the work and its  responsibilities following his hard and often penurious youth. In reporting his  death to the Locomotive Committee Webb said &quot;he was a very able and faithful  servant of the Company.&quot; A grant of six months' salary, less amount paid on  sick leave, was given to his four children aged 23 to 14, for he was a widower.  Dick came to take much part in Crewe local affairs. He was deputy mayor to Webb  in the Jubilee year of 1887, and presided at the public dinner to celebrate the  Queen's Jubilee and Crewe's railway jubilee, for Webb as mayor of the borough  was away at the national thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. He was treasure  r of the Mechanics Institute 1875-81. After Dick's death in 1888 a shelter was  erected in the then new Queen's Park i</p>
    <p>n memory of him; he himself had supervised the layout of the park.  Webb and Dick always got on well together and were much of an age.  One of Dick's letters preserved long after his death shows him to have  been human and unaffected, and gives a good first-hand account of  Crewe in the mid-1880s. </p>

        The first meeting of the Friends of Queens Park which has   					taken over from the Stakeholder
        <p>took place on Tuesday night with a trip around the park   					to see the progress led by Ian Bright, </p>
        <p>from EBM consultants. A lot turned up despite the bad   					weather and darkness.<br />

          <br />
          We were shown the new roadway being built by the lake as a   					temporary measure so </p>
        <p>heavy machinery can move about the park such as diggers   					and cranes.</p>
        <p><br />

          <br />
          A lot of work has been done on Burma Island and half of the   					island has been removed so </p>
        <p>it can be rebuilt. All the islands will need most of the   					surrounding brick work removed </p>
        <p>and rebuilt to prevent collapse </p>
        <p><br />
          <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SuDipMGIFcI/AAAAAAAABOM/kH6rTvFIyVQ/s1600-h/DSCF1152.JPG"> <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SuDipMGIFcI/AAAAAAAABOM/kH6rTvFIyVQ/s400/DSCF1152.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5395561550839289282" border="0" /></a><br />
          <br />
          We were then shown Broad walk and the band stand. Most of   					the path is full of heavy</p>
        <p> machinery and work has been done on the main bridge   					which will span the valley to </p>
        <p>Coronation Walk. The heavy wooden bridge will be   					supported by a large arch and </p>
        <p>this time it will be level with steps on one side and a   					disabled ramp on the other </p>
        <p>so people can get to Coronation Walk. It will all be   					replanted. </p>

          <br />
          Its hoped the new bridges will arrive in January- February   					and will then be put in</p>
        <p> place with huge cranes as the bridge will have to   					come in large pieces. It will be </p>
        <p>major work to get these cranes into confined spaces but   					it is all planned. </p>
        <p>The lake area should be open by March and the paths will   					be rebuilt as a</p>
        <p> temporary measure. In the future the paths will   					have to be closed so new </p>
        <p>ones can be built once all the work has been done. Its   					hoped the lake will</p>

        There was a big stink at the Queens park today as all the   					flowers in the main drive were removed and tons of new soil   					and manure were delivered ready for next years growth. So we   					should have some good displays next year but in the mean   					time the park has some good healthy smells<br />

        Down at the lake work was being done on Burma Island and   					down by the sluice gates. Wrekins display boards were being   					removed at long last. So people can now go down to the park   					and see some action at last. Its been a frustrating time for   					all and tempers have frayed with no work since early this   					year.

    <p><strong>Queens Park Restoration Project   			Stakeholders Meeting No 14 Chairman's Report by Councillor Roy   			Cartlidge Date 15th of September 2009.</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
    <p><br />
      It's seems a very long time since our last meeting 8th of July to be   			precise but I hope you will agree with me it's been worth it, I say   			that because of all the bad publicity of the past I now believe we   			have turned a new chapter on the restoration front.<br />
      The long wait has given time for the outstanding works to be   			organised and contracts to be signed and the works although very   			much behind the scenes work has been carried-out on the following:   			Culvert, landscaping works and railing base at Victoria Ave along   			with work to restore the bandstand on site this was carried out   			without any problems for our resident bats population.</p>
    <p><br />
      All this was noted on a walkabout with officers concerned and feel   			confident that the project is once again back on track for a grand   			opening ceremony sometime I hope in the late summer 2011 this needs   			further discussion along with the formation of a new Friends Group   			which hopefully take over the role of community consultation on the   			Park and associated issues like events and visitor support.<br />
      The only fly in the ointment is the re-jigging of the proposed   			design of the park buildings but I have been assured that this was   			necessary to make sure that the works would be carried out on time   			and to budget so a saving here and there has helped in ensuring that   			our park is well on the way to completion.</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Other Issues:</strong><br />
    The works are being carried out in a structured way to ensure that   			damage to existing infrastructure is not damaged by the heavy   			machinery the bridges are key element in this only when they are in   			place can the other associated work be started like the coronation   			walk landscaping, Lake Works, sluice gates/overflow along with clock   			tower / Boer War Memorial and building construction works commences   			on the new cafeteria, bowling pavilion. The depot building, I   			believe this is where the compromise on cost and build quality was   			made, so not the purpose built depot we were promised but a   			utilisation of one of the Lodges. The West &amp; East Lodges are now   			going to be used for day to day running of the park with   			administration, staff accommodation and a far better purpose served   			than residential lettings. An unforeseen benefit re the loss of the   			Depot build is that it leave more space for Park use.</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Friends Group:</strong><br />
      I wish them well for the future and only good work and dedication   			can be expected from them to put the public and visitors first and   			keep a sense of community within our fine Victorian parkland.<br />
      Grand Reopening Ceremony:<br />
      I hope we can discuss this further at tonight's meeting I have   			raised this with the leadership of the Council already, A Prom in   			the Park event in the evening,<br />
      And a Victorian theme throughout the day hot air balloons, steam   			fair and attractions?<br />
      Yes that is what it could be like it remains to be seen whether or   			not it will! It's really down to you who will be present at the   			meeting to follow this through to its conclusion.</p>
    <p><br />
      <strong>Connect2 Cycle Way:</strong><br />
      This project is due to start at the Crewe end of the route this will   			involve work around the boundary of the park in Queens Park Drive   			areas and new car park construction associated with it and   			installation of road safety infrastructure this is to start early   			2010 and a lot of work must be completed before March or no later   			than April around this particular part of the route this will ensure   			that it will not compromise the works or progress of the park works   			and in fact help to enhance the overall scheme to improve a grot   			spot just outside one of the park entrances to the west. The final   			completion date of the entire route given by Sustrans as 2013 Crewe   			to Nantwich.<br />
      The Friends Group need to be on the stakeholders/steering group for   			this contact:<br />

      Crewe CW1 3BY<br />
      For further information.<br />
      Conclusion:<br />
      Finally I would like to thank everyone who has attended the   			stakeholders meetings in the past and present, whatever your views   			differing or otherwise you have made a contribution to the success   			of the park and we have all come along way since the C&amp;NBC days we   			can all now hopefully see the end product in sight.<br />
      Thanks to the officers and staff of the park and councils past and   			present for their professionalism in carrying out their duties to   			such a high degree under such difficult conditions.<br />

      The last Stakeholder meeting took place at the Queens Park   				Yesterday Tuesday 15th September. It was a long meeting going on   				from 6 o&rsquo;clock to 8 o&rsquo;clock with a good turn out. So much was   				discussed but the main points were.<br />
  <br />
      The first was the election for officers for the new Friends of   				the Queens Park which will now take over from the Stakeholders   				and will develop the park and generally see the park through the   				restoration and beyond. Anyone who want to join and its open to   				everyone should contact<br />
      Elaine Dodd<br />
      Queens Park Manager<br />
      Tel: 01270 537896.<br />
  <br />
      The second most important item which everyone wants to know is   				the new contractor is Tolent Construction and there website is <a href="http://www.tolent.co.uk/">http://www.tolent.co.uk/</a>.   				The officers explained that lots of checks and safeguards were   				in place to ensure they didn&rsquo;t fail us like Wrekin did. There   				are penalty clauses and deposits to ensure the work is done   				correctly and on time. They should be on site by next week and   				we hope we can see some action very soon; they will be doing the   				bridges, lake etc.<br />
  <br />
  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SrFqfjBGfzI/AAAAAAAABLQ/3bYdveKf9Ng/s1600-h/2009_0916Image0008.JPG"> <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SrFqfjBGfzI/AAAAAAAABLQ/3bYdveKf9Ng/s400/2009_0916Image0008.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5382200119892803378" border="0" /></a><br />
      We then had a slide show of the work that had been done so far   				which included the work already done on the lake with part of   				the wall around the lake already done along with footing for the   				bridges etc. The banking along Victoria Ave is finished with a   				smoother transition to Coronation Walk and in doing this a lot   				of the mud from by the bandstand has been moved and the area   				cleared. Other work was the band stand which is on the main site <a href="http://www.crewetown.co.uk/7.htm">here</a> .<br />
  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SrFrHuQBI7I/AAAAAAAABLY/kS2pXAAsKrk/s1600-h/2009_0910Image0038.JPG"> <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/SrFrHuQBI7I/AAAAAAAABLY/kS2pXAAsKrk/s400/2009_0910Image0038.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5382200810102924210" border="0" /></a><br />
      Concern was expressed at the state of the child play area and it   				was planned this would be one of the last things done as it   				would be getting a lot of traffic with other work. They did   				promise to relook at this due to the complaints about the area   				and maybe this can be brought forward.<br />
  <br />
      Plans are being drawn up for the pavilion, bowling green and the   				lodges and should be available at the next meeting. The lodges   				will be used for park admin and possibly for education purposes   				which may contain a mini museum showing the history of the park.   				The current occupant of the east lodge is leaving soon after   				being there over 40 years.<br />
  <br />
      It was hoped a major event could be organized for a grand   				opening of the park in may 2011 and this would be a large scale   				event to promote the park </div>

    <p>Down at Coronation walk they have had to dig a hole into   					the mud which they have moved to support the north wall. The   					pipe that goes under the lake is blocked not in the park but   					outside. They have had to dig to find the problem and   					replace the pipe to connect Alton St to Victoria Ave and   					beyond </p>

  <p> 4th August and the final part of the new railings is going in   				along Victoria Ave. Apart from a odd few feet the railings are   				all now complete there is just the little bit waiting for new   				gates before they can do the last little bit.<br />
    <br />
    As you can see above the banking is going great guns and wont be   				long before its finished and at the same time the mass of mud   				has been moved from by the Bandstand so its real progress.</p>

  The Queens Park project has been surrounded by speculation and   				delays. Almost every aspect of the work has had its   				complications; however as Cheshire East Council strives forward   				it has put measures in place to literally get the earthmoving.<br />
  <br />
  Cheshire East Council is committed to supporting and utilising   				local businesses and the economy, the project team of   				Consultants and Contractors appointed to date are all North West   				based.<br />
  <br />
  This week has seen another local contractor earth moving,   				utilising the clay-soil deposits from the debris of the lake, to   				form the basis for new raised footpath improving access and   				supporting the original failing retention wall, all on the North   				West side of the Park.<br />
  <br />
  Even more exciting is that the Cheshire East specialist   				restorers &lsquo;<a href="http://www.lost-art.co.uk/">Lost Art</a>&rsquo;   				has been appointed to complete the Bandstand refurbishment and   				works commenced this Monday (20th).<br />
  <br />
  At a recent meeting with the Heritage Lottery and Cheshire East   				Council all parts demonstrated their commitment seeing the works   				progresses and finalised.<br />
  As the original contractor went into administration, the project   				legalities and the stoppage of works caused frustration, both   				within the Authority and to members of the public.<br />
  <br />
  On yet another positive note tenders for completion of the lake   				and bridge works have now been returned and are being reviewed   				by the Consultants, including the proposed building works   				required. It is anticipated that an announcement of the new   				Contractor will be made within weeks.<br />

<p align="justify">The work on the banking along Victoria Ave is   			well under way but at the moment resembles a mud bath with all the   			rain we have had. As well as the rebuilding of the wall they are   			moving the mud from the top area near the band stand so its two jobs   			getting done</p>

  <p> I attended the stakeholders meeting held at the park on   				Wednesday 8th July. There has been little or no visible work   				done at the park for months but that's all about to change. The   				new tender should be opened this week and hopefully a new   				contractor appointed very quickly. There has been a delay as   				after the tenders were in one contractor reduced the price and   				as a result other had to be given the opportunity to resubmit   				tenders.<br />
    <br />
    At the meeting the Lions came with some cash to build a sensory   				garden like the one a Stapley Water gardens so that is another   				new feature which should be a major attractions and as the Lions   				are funding it there is no messing about getting the money.<br />
    <br />
    The meeting discussed that the stakeholder work would be done   				once the park was finished and then a friends of the Queens Park   				would take over to make decisions about the park and see that   				its maintained and looked after. This will be open to anyone and   				will shortly be setup as a charity so they can get funding for   				any future projects. <br />
    <br />
    The work on the wall were the Bats have held up work is now due   				to start this week and should be finished in a month. This also   				means the railings can then be finished as there is only this   				small section to do. We will have pictures as soon as there is   				signs of life. Work on the bandstand is also imminent.<br />
    <br />
    The summer bedding is now starting to flower and will soon be in   				its full glory as can be seen above taken after the meeting.<br />
    <br />
    The park has events still going on this summer which are<br />

Costing over 1 million pounds it   				will link the Queens Park to Nantwich and means you will be able   				to walk or cycle to the park from Nantwich in safety along a   				beautiful country path. This should help make the park more   				accessible to all. Its hoped the work we have done in trying to   				get Tipkinder on the map will come into play as the path can   				then be extended via Tipkinder and the Valley Park and take you   				into the town centre. </p>

    <p> The work to redo the main wall flower bed by Victoria Ave is   					under way. This is a triple whammy as to redo the wall they   					are using mud that was taken from the lake. This mud has   					formed a mountain up near the band stand and as you can see   					above they are removing the mountain to use on the wall.<br />
      <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/Sl0QTubTbiI/AAAAAAAABDg/cRl683j9-FE/s1600-h/2009_0714Image0012.JPG"> <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/Sl0QTubTbiI/AAAAAAAABDg/cRl683j9-FE/s400/2009_0714Image0012.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5358457062706867746" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p>This work had been delayed as there were Bats nesting in   					the wall and they couldn't be disturbed. The work should   					take about 4 weeks and once that is done they can then   					replace the railings at the top. So that's 3 jobs done.</p>

<p>New Ducklings in the park 17 May 2009</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its good to see the wildlife are flourishing even if the park isn't   		as new ducklings were spotted in the lake. A few duck still remain and   		some even visit Tipkinder</p>

  Elaine  Dodd is the new Queens Park manager. The new post is   seen as a key role  in helping to transform the Victorian park to its   former glory.<br />
  <br />
  Delays in the redevelopment project have proved frustrating for the officers involved and loyal users of the park.<br />
  <br />
  It  is hoped an announcement will be made shortly as to whom   the selected  new contractors are who will continue with works stalled   when  contractor Wrekin went into liquidation. <br />
  <br />
  All that is happening at the park at the moment is the new railings are having their third coat of paint. </div>
