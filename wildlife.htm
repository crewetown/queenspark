          Some time ago we found out about the two white ducks   						from the person that brought them he said.<br />
          Hi, I am a regular visitor to the park and a real   						wildlife enthusiast. I by chance searched for wildlife   						sightings at the park to see If anyone logged the   						comings and goings and was very pleased to find your   						site. The reason I wish to contact you is to shed light   						on the two white ducks and let you know the story as I   						am the guy with the pet carrier who released them. I am   						a former manager of Stapeley water gardens and every yr   						we had numerous families of ducks, sadly as I'm sure   						your aware Stapeley closed and last yr a lot of ponds   						were filled in and one duck sat on eggs basically in a   						building site! Sadly many of the youngsters fell prey to   						the local cats and mum abandoned the two remaining   						youngsters on their very first day in the big wide   						world. I rescued the pair and one of my broody hens   						became stepmom. My plan was always to keep them as wild   						as possible and release them in a safe natural   						environment when I believed they would have a decent   						chance against predators! So this is exactly what I did   						and couldn't think of a better place than your park   						where they would have a helping hand with people   						regularly feeding the wildfowl their plus my regular   						visits. I hope this is ok in hindsight maybe I should   						have asked permission!? They are both standard mallards   						whose mum was the standard brown but they obviously have   						something from their father or mums ancestors in their   						genes. On seeing them on your website and noticing the   						insert about them bring brought in a cage I just wanted   						you to know the history behind them. <br />
          Now we only have one left we dodnt know if the other has   						left to get married or what has happened but its not   						been around for a couple of weeks. They used to be   						cheeky and visit the gardeners hut at dinner time for   						butties. </div>

          <p>Overview</p>
          <p>Not really a black-headed bird, more chocolate-brown   						- in fact, for much of the year, it has a white head. It   						is most definitely not a 'seagull' and is found commonly   						almost anywhere inland. Black-headed gulls are sociable,   						quarrelsome, noisy birds, usually seen in small groups   						or flocks, often gathering into larger parties where   						there is plenty of food, or when they are roosting. </p>
          <p>Where to see them
          </p>
          <p>The commonest inland gull, particularly in N England,   						Scotland and Wales. Large colonies along the south and   						east coasts of England. </p>
          <p>When to see them</p>
          <p>All year round. </p>
          <p>What they eat</p>
          <p>Worms, insects, fish and carrion. </p>

  <p>I was surprised to catch two Jays in the park while they are not a   		rare bird they are hard to take pictures of as they dont often break   		cover and are wary of people but with the Fugi HS10 with 30* optical   		zoom I managed to catch this one</p>

  <p>Another duck was out and about showing off her new family this week.   		There has been a lot of babies this time. What was shocking that as   		myself and another lady stood feeding the babies a child of about 3-4   		years old came up and tried to kick the babies as his mother stood there   		saying nothing. Its surprising how many parents let their children chase   		the poor baby ducks. It a sad reflection on society were people have no   		respect for wildlife and what will these children grow up to become if   		parents allow it? If you see it contact the Park staff this again   		highlights the need for Park Wardens</p>

The Grebe kept two chick and you cant very often see   							them as they ride on mums back they are a great team   							as the father brings fish for them and mum.</p>

  <p>The two white ducks were back this week and on Tuesday they had 3   			yellow chicks Wednesday they were down to two and by Thursday there   			was only one left. Lets hope this one survives what killing them we   			dont know but one disappeared in the day it was there at 2 pm by 5pm   			it had gone. People are still reporting Yobs throwing stones at   			young chicks so it you see this call the Police</p>

  <p>A baby Moorhen was trying to get back on the island this week but   			couldnt make it his parents were feeding him and he was hiding in   			bricks in  the island. Its a pity they didnt take wildlife into   			account when they did the islands </p>

          <p> This week a Greylag goose arrived in the park.</p>
          <p>The ancestor of most domestic geese, the greylag   							is the largest and bulkiest of the wild geese native   							to the UK and Europe. In many parts of the UK it has   							been re-established by releasing birds in suitable   							areas, but the resulting flocks (often mixed with   							Canada geese) found around gravel pits, lakes and   							reservoirs all year round in southern Britain tend   							to be semi-tame and uninspiring. The native birds   							and wintering flocks found in Scotland retain the   							special appeal of truly wild geese. </p>
          <h5>Where to see them</h5>
          <p>Greylag geese are easily seen in lowland areas of   							the UK all year, sometimes even in suburban parks   							with lakes but especially on low-lying grassy fields   							in river valleys. Wild ones, however, are found   							mostly north of the Solway and can be seen at RSPB   							nature reserves such as Mersehead (Dumfries &amp;   							Galloway), Vane Farm (Fife) and Loch of Strathbeg   							(Grampian) from September to April. Wild breeding   							greylags can be found at Forsinard (Caithnes &amp;   							Sutherland). </p>
          <p>When to see them</p>
          <p>All year round in the south; mostly September to   							March or April where wild visitors appear in the   							north. </p>
          <h3>What they eat
          </h3>
          <p>Grass, roots, cereal leaves and spilled grain </p>

          <p>Also back this week is the Heron looking for some   							fish he hasnt been for a fair few weeks</p>

          <p>On Wednesday the swans were messing about near   							Tipkinder bridge and by Friday it was evident they   							had built a nest as the swan above was sitting on it   							being very protective. This could be a problem give   							the yobs who chase ducks etc as if they mess with a   							swan which is a royal bird they can fight back. They   							dont know Kung Fu but an ancient art called I Peck   							You. You are advised to walk past them very quietly   							as they are right next to the path if you let kids   							make a lot of noise they may get chased off.  </p>

          <p>The poor old Grebe is having less luck as here   							they are building a nest close to the bank only to   							have it destroyed by kids once again we want   							desperately to get some hay bails next to the island   							were they can nest in peace. Bo the Grebe and swans   							are protected birds and heavy fines if you attack   							them. The local Police have been around this week   							after complaints of kids throwing at ducks and   							attacking them lets hope they keep up the patrols</p>

  <p>One of the side effects of the royal visit is the barriers were   			taken down for the day and people took the opportunity to get around   			the park like the south side were the Grebes are on the nest and   			this has caused problems as the mother has been disturbed and kept   			jumping off the nest.</p>

Thousands of people from all   over the country are protesting in many forms from march's to direct   action supported by prominent people like<strong> Sir David Attenborough,</strong>, Chris Packham, Brian May      <br />
                    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NrU6WaCH_Gg/V9HpU7SYbFI/AAAAAAAARK8/zS4YVozgREc/s1600-h/clip_image0023.jpg"><img alt="clip_image002" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZAxH6aFscdQ/V9HpVWldsPI/AAAAAAAARLA/NwsLaCNiP-4/clip_image002_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image002" height="372" border="0" width="523" /></a> <br />
                    A note on the badger cull is worth including here; the policy is being   carried out in ten zones this year, with an upper limit of 14,213   badgers set by the licenses, and there's every indication it'll be   carried out in South Cheshire in 2017. The given reason is to tackle   bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a disease affecting cattle herds. Advocates   of badger culling participate at their peril; there's very little   scientific evidence to suggest this will help them at all, and in fact   the opposite is likely to be true in some cases. In the Randomised   Badger Culling Trial, a previous experiment that cost us 11,000+ badgers   and £50 million, the conclusion was that badger culling makes no   meaningful contribution to bTB control; in some areas of this experiment   it even increased the disease prevalence. <br />
                    This seems to be the situation now; bTB has increased in each of the   three cull zones from 2015 if stats from May 2015 vs May 2016 are   compared. The current cull has also cost us approximately £25 million   for approximately 4,000 badgers (none of which are tested for bTB at   all) according to DEFRA statistics reported in 'Badgered To Death', the   new book of Dominic Dyer, current CEO of The Badger Trust. Because they   aren't tested, there is absolutely no data on how prevalent the disease   is amongst the badgers that are being killed. Perhaps if they were   tested, it would make it even clearer that the disease is an issue   stemming from the poor husbandry of intensively farmed cattle,   subsequently spilling out into many wild hosts as what is essentially   industrial pollution, infecting not just badgers, but rats, hedgehogs,   otters &amp; deer as well. <br />
                    <strong>Warning you may find this video disturbing as badgers are often shot   and scream for a long time in agony before they die and it can be a   mother and her young will starve to death would farmers do this to their   cattle</strong>? <br />

                    <br />
                    It cost £7000 to cull a badger £300 to inoculate Under a vaccination   programme being used in Wales, around 25,000 badgers could have been   vaccinated for the same cost of killing just under 2,500 in   Gloucestershire and Somerset, according to Dyer. The badger vaccine   doesn't kill any TB but stops them infecting anything so those with TB   die leaving health badgers. The TB test for cattle is ineffective many   are killed as they show positive only to find on post mortem they were   clean it is also very painful for cows. <br />
                    <strong>Many if not all Badgers killed may not be infected with TB</strong>     <br />

                    The policy is unlikely to be stopped by appealing to the common sense of   those who have already ignored the warnings of countless researchers   &amp; experts that have examined the evidence.

Concerns this week as to how they have been tamed and if   you dont know   and feed them they eat out of your hand problem was one   women had a baby   with her and they frightened the mother as she   thought they were   attacking the baby.

            <p>Goosanders   in the park starting with one then today Mondays   we had four of them.   These handsome diving ducks are a member of the   sawbill family, so   called because of their long, serrated bills, used   for catching fish. A   largely freshwater bird, the goosander first bred   in the UK in 1871. It   built up numbers in Scotland and then since   1970 it has spread across   northern England into Wales, reaching   south-west England. Its love of   salmon and trout has brought it into   conflict with fishermen. It is   gregarious, forming into flocks of   several thousand in some parts of   Europe</p>

	        <p>The   cygnets are doing well with no more fishing problems   and are growing   well the only real danger to them now comes from   humans and fishing. The   cygnet in Stapley may be able to come back in a   couple of weeks lets   hope it doesnt get driven off</p>

Once again the low life that do this don't     report it to the RSPCA or anyone to get it help they run off and   leave   it to die a horrible painful death.

            <p>The   problem is there is no end in site things are just   getting worse with   an almost daily problem and these are not kids   fishing these are adults   doing this. Nothing is being done to stop   this happening. You can see   below an illegal act not just park rules   but its illegal to leave a rod   unattended as it states on the licence <a title="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/rod-limits" href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/rod-limits">https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/rod-limits</a> if found by the environment agency  you can get a hefty fine and banned from fishing <a title="http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm" href="http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm">http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm</a></p>
            <p>Once   kids start in the school hols things will be totally   out of control and   the CEC are doing nothing to help the situation   they are covering up   criminal acts when swans are attacked every   incident with a swan attack   should be reported to the police not   covered up.</p>
            <p>Something must   be done I have heard of people suggesting   vigilantly patrols and this   must be condemned but people are shocked   and upset by lack of response   by the park </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Going by other park rules in the uk the rules need to be changed</p>
            <p>no ground baiting (the wildlife see this and come over then the angler doesn't lift the rod)</p>
            <p>Clear   notices of how to contact the bailiff so people can   report problems and   if they hook wildlife report it. The stupid £5 fee   want increasing to a   reasonable £30 then this would pay for more   bailiffs</p>
            <p>No catapults these are weapons and not suitable in the park as last week the kids were firing at wildlife.</p>
            <p>Bailiffs   to note who is on what peg and times and that   person is responsible for   the peg and to clean up after them ie no   left line this would also give   a clue as to who was fishing if   wildlife are hurt.</p>
            <p>No casting close to wildlife and rods to be lifted if wildlife come close</p>
            <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Ty4XR3ckbIY/U9WRvsYxqoI/AAAAAAAAMQ8/IzBC6guTRyo/s1600-h/DSCF8960%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF8960" alt="DSCF8960" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ULwacDHA84s/U9WRwetE5aI/AAAAAAAAMRA/95UC8NMu4zA/DSCF8960_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="360" border="0" width="540" /></a></p>
            <p>Apart form the cygnets there are a lot of baby ducks moorhens and rabbits to see in the park at this time</p>

                  <p>Last   Sat 12th,they  had to use a boat to reach a   cygnet that was tangled in   fishing line. On Mon 14th Derek, one of the   bailiffs, had to untangle a   cygnet from fishing line. What sort of   fisherman hooks up cygnets then   leaves them in horrendous pain to die   instead of reporting it to the   RSPCA or the bailiff they can be only   described as low life. If you see   anyone doing this report it straight   away. Its very clear and proven   beyond a shadow of a doubt that all   these problems come from fishing   which is what the wildlife group   tried to stop <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/</a></p>
                  <p>Once   the kids come off school things can only get   worse and CEC are not   doing anything to solve the problem. Despite the   bailiffs and people   turning out to help these things are still   happening so they have proved   in effective. So far its only swans that   have been the main victims but   the Grebe on the lake this week is   also a protect species. Part of the   problem is fishermen using ground   bate which the swans see and think its   food then swim over and get   caught as the fishermen wont lift their   rods to save them. The   bailiffs Tel number needs to be displayed all   around the area so   people can report problems. The low fee of £5 is   stupid and should be   £35 or so this would provide money for more   bailiffs.      </p>

	          <p>got   back from visiting our cygnet at Stapeley. How cool   to be allowed to   see him but how sad to hear he has a 50/50 chance of   surviving. His   injury, confirmed to be caused by FISHING LINE has made   him unable to   walk. If he can not put weight on his leg and is unable   to walk he will   have to be put to sleep. Made me want to cry. Poor   little thing. He is   on painkillers and my fingers are crossed. More   care MUST be taken when   fishing. This is a protected species.</p>
	          <p>If there is no action taken   by the fishing group and the   park management then more are going to die   the fishermen throw in   ground bait and the swans think its food so come   over to them we   watched today as swans swam under rods and the   fishermen made no   attempt to lift the rod to keep them safe. Once the   kids start then   all hell will break loose and the council will do   nothing they remove   any comments on Face Book trying to pretend nothing   is happening. If   the RSPCA gave the fishing group a £4,000 vets bill   every time this   happened they may get their act together.</p>

              <p>Today   volunteers from Queens Park Wildlife Conservation   mounted a rescue of   the injured cygnet and many turned up to keep an   eye on it while waiting   for the RSPCA. Most of the day members have   been on the phone trying to   get help for it. The RSPCA turned up later   in the day and helped by   volunteers who are known to the swans it was   captured and taken away to   Stapley as it was in to bad of a state to   leave. What shocked a lot of   people was that this was all done by   volunteers while management who get   paid to do the job by CEC did   nothing. Its there job to take action on   injured swans and give a swan   in distress caused by fishermen top   priority.</p>

      <p>Call   to ban fishing in the Queens Park after attacks on cygnets.   The female   swan died and the body was disposed of so no one could   examine it but   the pictures of the dead swan sent to lots of swan   rescue centres   believe the injury was from a fishing hook as it&rsquo;s a   unique wound and   these are people that rescue swans every day. They   cant be 100% as there   is no body but they believe it to be the case. </p>
      <p>Two cygnets were   witnessed being attacked by fishermen purposely   trying to hook them one   did hook one. Another witness saw a fisherman   hitting the swan with a   landing net, a week ago a cygnet was rescued   tangled in fishing line   Sunday saw kids fishing and using a catapult   to fire on cygnets and wild   life. Today a cygnet has been caught in   line again. Other witness have   seen the attacked with spray cans.   Fishermen have been seen kick at   swans My dog was caught in a fishing   hook left on the grass as have   other dogs. Fishermen should have to be   signed onto a peg then any   problems they can be spoken to as its   their responsibility </p>
      <p><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t34.0-12/q73/s720x720/10536463_254804781380098_1753743427_n.jpg?oh=008b83c8c23e379b854b1531fe2903dc&amp;oe=53C654A1&amp;__gda__=1405491946_c6543e5b29465f7e61cc8980017c7ef2" height="400" width="300" /></p>
      <p>The injured cygnet has to wait until tomorrow for the RSPCA to rescue it lets hope its ok</p>
      <p>All   these are actual crimes swans enjoy statutory protection   under the   Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to   intentionally   injure, take or kill a wild swan. As far as we can tell   these crimes   have been covered up and not reported to the Police which   in its self   may be a crime and CEC may be guilty of this. </p>
      <p>Given this level   of attacks the only sensible action is to ban   fishing before we have a   wildlife blood bath despite peoples efforts   these crimes are increasing   and measures to stop them are not working.   Some swan rescue centres who   have had this sort of problem hold the   fishing club responsible and   charge them £4,000 for every rescue and   vets bill. All this when we are   supposed to have responsible fishermen   once the kids break up and we get   swamped with then all hell will   break loose. If action isn&rsquo;t taken then   people may start taking action   against these people as the CEC sit back   and do nothing again. </p>
      <p>The new wildlife group have people   looking after the swans as   best they can and you can join in and help   save the swans on facebook <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/</a></p>
      <p>Anyone   seeing attacks on swans should call the Police as its a   criminal   offence lets get the Police down and prosecute these people   it will   deter others from doing it </p>

            <p>After the horrific <a href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2014/06/dead-swan.html">Death of the mother swan</a> who had 7 signets in the Queens Park which is still a mystery more     attacks have happened this week. We heard disturbing news off a bailiff     fisherman. He has witnessed <strong>twice in one day</strong>, two   males   fishing who purposely dangled bait in front of the cygnets and   caught   them up. The bailiff had to untangle them and threaten the   males   involved. Another witness told me how he had seen a fisherman   hitting a   swan with a keep net so that is a total of 3 attacks in one   day. The   mothers death is still a mystery as its claimed by the press   that the   RSPCA have no knowledge of it but it was quoted on Face Book   that the   park had called them and it was the wardens who had made the   call but   speaking to them this week they said they hadn't made a call   and knew   nothing about the dead swan. The body has disappeared and a   request to   the park were it went hasnt been answered. A vet who   specialises in   swans looked at our photo and said with out the body he   cant be sure but   it looked like a human attack from the photo as   there were no canine   teeth marks. </p>

            <h5>Legal status</h5>
            <p>As   native wild birds, swans enjoy statutory   protection under the Wildlife   and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an   offence to intentionally injure,   take or kill a wild swan.  </p>
            <p>The Act similarly protects the eggs   and nests of   swans. It is an offence to take or possess the egg of a   wild mute   swan, or to damage or destroy the nest of a mute swan whilst   in use or   being built. Unfortunately, swans and their nests are   sometimes a   target for vandals.  </p>
            <p>Anyone seeing an offence against   swans or other   wildlife is encouraged to contact their police Wildlife   Liaison   Officer through their local police station. </p>
            <p>There is   history at the Queens Park of swan abuse   with vandals stealing and   smashing their eggs and no one does anything   about it but now a new   wildlife conservation group has been formed   and the first meeting will   be in the Queens Park pavilion Sun 6th July   if you want to help save the   wildlife in the park come along. You may   wish to ask your local   councillor why the CEC isnt doing anything to   protect the wildlife as   they have a duty of care. Since the attacks   they have taken no action to   patrol the park or get the Police in to   investigate. </p>

            <p>There are still 6 signets left and we have lots of people watching out for them after the mysterious death of the mother. <strong>The     controversy roles on with claims made by the press that the RSPCA no     nothing about the death  even though the park made this statement on      Face book</strong>  Sadly Swan found dead on the lake this morning.     RSCPA notified. All indications are eaten, possibly by a fox, no     indication of being ravished by dog. Hence previous assumption removed     off the web as unnecessary. However, mum may possibly find it difficult     to look after all her young, so please all keep monitoring them and     help. She has plenty of food thank you to all.

            <p>Urgent need for ramps onto all islands on the lake so wildlife can escape onto them away from human and natural predators </p>
            <p>Islands to be planted with wildlife friendly plants to provide cover and suitable nesting </p>
            <p>Lake   plants need to be planted to provide to oxygenate the   water and provide   nesting for wildlife reed beds are needed in the   middle of the lake for   protected species that cant nest on land ie   Grebe </p>
            <p>Make the park   more wildlife friendly by planting suitable   bushes and plants to   encourage wild life which fits in with the   schools education programme </p>
            <p>After   a serious dog attack last year we were promised a dog   control order   which hasn&rsquo;t been actioned dogs off the lead are a   major problem as they   attack wildlife and children the order is of no   use unless dog wardens   enforce it. The remaining swan was attacked   last week by a dog off the   lead. </p>
            <p>Small water holes to be placed around park for wildlife to drink from as most can drink from the lake. </p>
            <p>Log piles and bee hotel to get more insects in the park cost nothing and helpful for children&rsquo;s education. </p>
            <p>There will be a meeting in the park pavilion on Sunday 6th July 2pm all invited </p>

            <p>After   the death of the swan last week this week a   signet has gone missing and   its reported today that there are 100 dead   fish in the lake. A member   of swan watch witnessed a staffy type dog   attack the remaining swan   while it was off the lead. What is going on   when will someone do   something?</p>
            <p>The Wagtails are about on the lake catching flies for     their young and there is also baby moorhens on the lake they are very     tiny and vulnerable</p>

            <p>The   two swans have had 7 signets in the Queens Park a   few weeks ago. Last   year they had four signets the first time in 10   years but they all   disappeared in mysterious circumstances. This year   members of the   wildlife group from the park setup Swan watch so   members would come in   during opening times to keep an eye on the   swans. Last night 5 June at   7:15 they found mother the swan dead in   the bushes it had not been eaten   which suggests it was a fox that did   this as that would have only   killed for food. We believe its the   results of a dog attack as dogs off   the lead have been a problem for   along time. Witness saw a greyhound   type dog attack the signets a few   weeks ago until a member shouted at   the owner.</p>

            <p>A   photo taken today of a dog off the lead heading   towards the swans at   1:30. On Sunday a dog off the lead caused havoc   around the children's   play area for over an  hour. The park and the   dog wardens refuse to do   their jobs and protect both children and   wildlife.</p>
            <p>The Park has   tried to cover up this story and are   lying about the incident below you   can see on QP facebook they claim   it was dead in the water and reported   to the RSPCA when it was   reported the night before by our members why   are they lying and trying   to cover up what has happen?</p>

            <p>Sadly   Swan found dead on the lake this morning. RSCPA   notified. All   indications are eaten, possibly by a fox, no indication   of being   ravished by dog. Hence previous assumption removed off the   web as   unnecessary. However, mum may possibly find it difficult to   look after   all her young, so please all keep monitoring them and help.   She has   plenty of food thank you to all. Thank you Waynne also for   your prompt   call. </p>

    <p>Its   a major wildlife week this week with 7 baby swans being   born. Last year   was the first year we had young but none survived so   this year is a   bumper year. There are baby ducks one has 12 babies   another with 5 and   one with 4 but these tend to loose a lot to gulls   and dogs. There have   been idiots with a black dog letting it chase   duck on Sunday.</p>

            <p>The   first baby ducks appeared this week with the   mother of 5 chicks   swimming around. How long will they last as people   watched on Sunday as   kids in a boat chased them all over the lake   trying to run the chicks   over and the staff never saw anything. The   boat have duel hulls so they   can run   them over and kill them with   the paddle blades</p>

    <p>The   grebe was back  again this week but was down the   bottom of the lake and   at risk from fishing as they dive and swim   great distances under water   were they can be caught in the line. They   are a protected species and   heavy fines if they are hurt</p>

    <p>With   the swan on the nest the other swan has become a   killer spending most   of the day attacking Canada geese all around the   park. We watched as he   jumped on the back of one and pushed it under   the water and it never   came back up. This isnt the first time they   have done this they killed   one of the white geese before.</p>

            <p>The   swan is still nesting on the island but after we   bought hay to help her   build a nest the park manager refused to get it   put on the island so   she has no material to make a decant nest which   will have an impact as   eggs will be colder without straw to keep them   warm. There are no   materials for any wildlife to build nest and much   of the cover they used   to hide has been destroyed by the ANTS last   year</p>

            <p>The friends meeting was held last week and the <a href="http://www.crewetown.co.uk/friends.htm" target="_blank">mins are here</a> The interesting bits are they now have money to pay to restore thing     that have been restored. They are also contemplating a web site which     would evolve spending money raised for the park on it instead of     providing nesting for wildlife or other useful things. Considering my     two sites  have been running for over 5 years with 1,000 of photo and     weekly reports wit hover a million hits whats the point of wasting money     on another one? I had an offer from the scouts to help the ANTS and I     passed this on to them over a week ago and they have not responded so   I   assume they dont want help?</p>

            <h5>The   wigeon above  is a medium-sized duck with a   round head and small bill.   The head and neck of the male are chestnut,   with a yellow forehead, pink   breast and grey body. In flight birds   show white bellies and males have   a large white wing patch. Birds   breed in central and northern Scotland   and also in northern England.   Many birds visit the UK in winter from   Iceland, Scandinavia and   Russia. With large numbers of wintering birds   at a few UK sites it is   an Amber List species.</h5>

They were not   taking any care were they   										cast and the swans and their   babies swam   										close to them.

The hook was   										removed from the swans neck   safely. <br />
	                The RSPCA advised the fisher men of what   									  	they had done.

They spoke to the ones who   										had hooked the   swan and took no action   										and left them fishing to do it   again. </p>
	              <p>The PCSO said they don&rsquo;t have the   										  powers to shift anyone illegal fishing   										or take any action   for dogs off the   										lead. Even when they break into fenced   		  								off areas to fish causing criminal   										damage they wont   take any action. They   										will only take action if fish are   		  								removed from the park as then they will   										charge them   with theft. In the past   										other PSCO have attended and taken     										action on the fishing. </p>
	              <p>Below the RSPCA remove line and hook   										  from the swan if you view this full   										screen you can see the   line wrapped   										around its neck </p>

	              <p>They claim that any volunteer wardens   										  can not stop anyone fishing or do   										anything about dogs off   the lead. They   										say its down to the council or   										  environment agency this puts the ball   										directly back in Cllr   Jones court as   										people are volunteering but they are   						  				wasting their time as the council refuse   										to back the   project. People volunteer   										and act as wardens to keep the   park safe   										for families  risking abuse and the   										  council wont help in anyway. Cllr Jones   										spoke on tv of a   partnership but it&rsquo;s a   										one sided one if the council wont do     										their bit </p>
	              <p>This is the second time in a couple   										of   months a swan has been hooked up and   										one women has been   hooked as well. A   										risk assessment would say the odds are   	  									that a person be it a baby an OAP or   										other is going   to suffer horrendous   										injure   while the council refuse to     										take action on this fishing which is   										conducted   next to busy public pathways   										by people who don&rsquo;t care were   they cast   										the line. The council have a duty of   										  care to keep the park safe for people to   										enjoy by failing on   Health and Safety   										grounds they leave themselves open to   	  									being sued if any one is injured given   										the fact   they have been told the risk   										and taken no action on dogs or   fishing.   										Evidence on Facebook and the website   										  could be used by anyone suing the   										council if they get   injured. </p>

	                Most people who visit the park do so to   										  feed the ducks or show them to the   										children and they are   horrified that   										they can be killed by people illegally   				  						fishing. One of the baby swans is   										missing and its   possible its died a   										horrible death by fishing line, by a dog     										off the lead  or by a fox. </p>

            <p> We had three baby swans born in July but now we are   		  					down to just one 2 have mysteriously disappeared the   							last   one to go is the weak one above and its been   							gone a week now.   The chances of a fox or similar   							getting 2 swans when the   parents are about and lots   							of other ducks to choose from must   be a million to   							one.We suspect that they may have been taken.   The   							last one was week and its possible that it could   							  have swallowed lead shot from illegal fishing. We   							have searched   the park for a body or evidence of an   							attack but no signs of   it.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/"> <strong>Wildlife Facebook Page</strong></a></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We have started a new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/"> Facebook Group for Wildlife in the park</a> to   							ensure the wildlife are considered in the park and   						  	future planting is done to encourage new wildlife to   							come to   the park. Plants are needed in the lake   							which was part of the   original plan to provide   							nesting areas food etc for wildlife,   ramps up to the   							island are also needed as often wildlife breads   on    							the islands as  its safe  but then baby moorhens etc   			  				cant get back on to safety once they leave. Places   							near the   islands need to be constructed so duck   							swans can breed in   safety away from vandals. The   							diversity of wildlife is slowly   growing as the park   							get back to normal but more needs to be   done to   							encourage buttery flies, birds etc to come to the   			  				park. Wildlife is not considered when planning   							things for   the park as an example the islands have a   							overhang that stops   them getting on to it.</p>
            <p>We are seeking volunteers to help look after   							  wildlife record whats seen so people know what to   							look for the   following years etc. A dedicated group   							feed the ducks on a   daily basis but we need to   							educate people what food to give   instead of white   							bread.</p>
            <h5>Good Foods for Ducks</h5>
            <p>The best foods for ducks are those that provide   							  the nutrients, minerals and vitamins the birds need   							for healthy   growth and development. Many of these   							foods are similar to the   natural seeds, grains and   							plants the birds will <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/Bird-Glossary-E-G/g/Forage.htm"> forage</a> on their own. As <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/birdingglossary/g/Omnivorous.htm"> omnivorous</a> birds, ducks will eat a great deal of   							different foods, and the best foods to offer ducks   							include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/Foods/a/Cracked-Corn.htm"> Cracked corn</a></li>
              <li>Wheat, barley or similar grains </li>
              <li>Oats (uncooked; rolled or quick) </li>
              <li>Rice (cooked or uncooked) </li>
              <li>Milo </li>
              <li>Birdseed (any type or mix) </li>
              <li>Grapes (cut in half) </li>
              <li>Frozen peas or corn (defrosted, no need to   								cook) </li>
              <li>Earthworms </li>
              <li> <a href="http://birding.about.com/od/Foods/a/Mealworms.htm"> Mealworms</a> (fresh or dried) </li>
              <li>Chopped lettuce or other greens or salad   								mixes </li>
              <li>Vegetable trimmings or peels (chopped) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Duck feed pellets or poultry starter pellets are   						  	another great option, and they can be purchased from   							farming   or agricultural supply stores. </p>

                  <p> If you enlarge this photo full   											  screen you can see the fishing line   											in its mouth We tried   to report it   											today but the wardens refused to   											  answer the door even though we knew   											they were in. The   people fishing   											were still there and its likely it   							  				was them that did it. This is highly   											dangerous as they   are fishing next   											to public paths near Tipkinder last   				  							year a women got a hook in her coat   											as they dont   care were they cast. If   											there is not swift and meaningful     											action by the Police and Council to   											stop this   illegal fishing I am   											afraid it will end up with a child   	  										with a fish hook in its eye or   											similar. They can   then sue the   											council for failing its duty of   											  care. Its an accident waiting to   											happen we must have a   clamp down on   											this fishing or in summer we will be   						  					flooded with people fishing. It was   											reported on Sunday   a loose dog   											attacking wildlife and the owner was   							  				shouted at but just issued abuse.</p>

            <p> The first baby of the year was seen this week in   					  		this case a baby Canadian goose there have been no   							baby ducks   so far this year they are behind as lots   							of other places have   had them a few weeks. The Gulls   							are hovering around trying to   steal eggs again. The   							swans are nesting on the island like they   did last   							year but this time they have gone straight to the   	  						island as last year they laid several eggs in places   							and   they were smashed by kids. Lets hop in 3 weeks   							we see some baby   swans it will be the first time in   							many a year</p>

            <p> We have seen new wildlife in the park this week like   							the kestrel up near the bandstand and the playing   							fields.</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Falco tinnunculus </p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/falcons.aspx"> Falcons and allies</a> (Falconidae) </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Kestrels are found in a wide variety of habitats,   							from moor and heath, to farmland and urban areas.   							The only places they do not favour are dense   							forests, vast treeless wetlands and mountains. They   							are a familiar sight, hovering beside a motorway, or   							other main road. They can often be seen perched on a   							high tree branch, or on a telephone post or wire, on   							the look out for prey. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>

            <p>The Greylag goose was seen for an odd day he did   							that last year popped in for a short while</p>

            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p>Swans, ducks and geese (Anatidae) </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Greylag geese are easily seen in lowland areas of   							the UK all year, sometimes even in suburban parks   							with lakes but especially on low-lying grassy fields   							in river valleys. Wild ones, however, are found   							mostly north of the Solway and can be seen at RSPB   							nature reserves such as Mersehead (Dumfries &amp;   							Galloway), Vane Farm (Fife) and Loch of Strathbeg   							(Grampian) from September to April. Wild breeding   							greylags can be found at Forsinard (Caithnes &amp;   							Sutherland). </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round in the south; mostly September to   							March or April where wild visitors appear in the   							north. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>
            <p>Grass, roots, cereal leaves and spilled grain </p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/hawks.aspx"> Hawks, vultures and eagles</a> (Accipitridae)</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Now the commonest and most widespread UK bird of prey. It is   			quite large with broad, rounded wings, and a short neck and tail.   			When gliding and soaring it will often hold its wings in a shallow   			'V' and the tail is fanned. Birds are variable in colour from all   			dark brown to much paler variations, all have dark wingtips and a   			finely barred tail. Their plaintive mewing call could be mistaken   			for a cat.</p>
    <h3>Where to see them</h3>
    <p>Greatest numbers in Scotland, Wales, the Lake District and SW   			England, but now breeding in every county of the UK. Found in most   			habitats particularly woodland, moorland, scrub, pasture, arable,   			marsh bog and villages. May even be seen in towns and cities   			including Glasgow. Look for birds soaring over wooded hillsides in   			fine weather, or perched on fence posts and pylons. In some areas   			they are known as the tourists&rsquo; eagle, often being mistaken for this   			larger bird of prey.</p>
    <h3>When to see them</h3>
    <p>All year round. Birds soar, display and call most in spring.</p>
    <h3>What they eat</h3>
    <p>Small mammals, birds and carrion. And even earthworms and large   			insects when other prey is in short supply.</p>

Many people loved him as he   							was so peaceful. We have had him over 8 years he was   							a recue dog with seven homes before us. He suffered   							with a rare eye complaint which meant most of his   							life he was going blind till in the end his vision   							was very small. He loved the park and often lay   							there while ducks pecked bread of him. This week we   							had to say good bye as he was in pain from his neck   							,not eating, sad.

            <p>We have now got a Alaskan Malamute puppy Jax   							above he is only 9 weeks old and when full grown   							will be 130 lbs plus and be able to pull several   							tons on a sledge and will look like the dog below.   							Jax has his <a target="_blank" href="http://alaskanmalamutejax.blogspot.co.uk/"> own blog as people</a> want to know how you raise   							these dogs. Once he has had his injection and big   							enough he will be seen around the park like Max</p>

    <p>A lot of baby rabbits about this week a bit timid but there are   			lots to be seen if you walk around quietly. The swans and Grebe are   			still  sitting on the nests and its hoped we will see some new life   			from them soon. What could be more important is the Barnacle Goose   			has been sitting on a nest for a while. It a very rare bird in this   			part of the world but they have never bread in the uk there were   			some at Tatton Park in 1972 but they never had young so if ours has   			young even crossed with others it will be a national event.</p>

    <p>The coots had three young this week but sadly by Friday they were   			down to just the one they do look poor little things. Some at the   			other end of the park have also had young and have survived so far.   			We suspect its gulls taking the young all the time.</p>

            <p> This week we had over 17 kids in the park illegally   							fishing after some of the fish that can  be seen in   							the lake.

            <p>Channel 4  is making a major series with Heston   							Blumenthal which aims to bring back to life the fun   							and nostalgia of our favourite foods. In each   							episode, Heston will research one of our favourite   							eating experiences and put his unusual twist on   							them, making people take time out of their busy   							lives to come together as communities and rekindle   							their fond food memories.  He plans to not only make   							these meal-times innovative and delicious, but to   							make them supersized too – to amaze and feed the   							masses. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In this episode Heston wants to bring back the   							ice cream experience that we had when we were   							younger and this Ice Cream Olympics day is an   							opportunity to find out what the public remember   							about their favourite ice creams. We would like   							members of the Crewe community to come down at 2pm   							on Saturday June 16th  with old   							photographs of them or their family eating ice   							creams to show Heston. </p>
            <p>Please let me know if you are able to come along   							and if you have anything suitable to bring – so I   							can let the producer know!! </p>

            <p> A few report this week of people witnessing the   							swans being attacked by yobs. There are very stiff   							penalties if they are caught so if you see anyone   							doing this ring the Police as they are a protected   							bird.</p>
            <p>What do swans eat I am often asked</p>
            <p>So what do swans eat? The following are the   							common foods that most swans eat: </p>
            <p>• Aquatic Plants - since swans spend most of   							their time in bodies of water like ponds and lakes,   							they also source out their food from here. They   							usually feed on stems, roots, leaves, tubers and   							other parts of any aquatic plants. This is not a   							problem for swan raised on natural bodies of water;   							however, people that raise their swans in man-made   							ponds or lakes must ensure that aquatic plants are   							present to serve as the swan's food. </p>
            <p>• Insects - swans also wander on land and they   							can eat whatever small insect that may come into   							their way. This includes snails, aquatic beetles and   							many more. This is the intriguing part about what do   							swans eat; at first people thought that swans are   							purely herbivorous but as time passes by, it was   							discovered that swans also feed on small insects. </p>
            <p>• Small Aquatic Animals - this includes shrimps,   							small fishes and other small aquatic animals. These   							aquatic animals are eaten by fully mature swans   							living in a natural pond or lake. </p>
            <p>• Grains and Vegetables - this is the usual food   							for domesticated swans, especially those that are   							raised on farms. Swans on captivity feed on corns   							and other grains as well as on left over vegetable   							scraps. </p>
            <p><strong>Grain, such as wheat, and vegetable   							matter, especially lettuce and potatoes, can be fed   							to swans.</strong> Food should be thrown into the   							water to avoid encouraging the birds onto the bank. </p>
            <p>This week 7 staff came down to put a hay bail and   							pallets in the lake for the swans and grebes to nest   							on away from the banks were they are being attacked.   							Above the man wades out to fit the hay. </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yePGtudrnOE/T8Ktfv1R1xI/AAAAAAAAFbs/8_PY7354g3I/s1600-h/DSCF6834%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF6834" alt="DSCF6834" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-amBLaAGrARQ/T8KtgZkAy_I/AAAAAAAAFb0/fpAF1LZDYvQ/DSCF6834_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="399" width="531" /></a></p>
            <p>The swans tried it out the next day but now seem   							to have used it to get onto the island so lets hope   							they nest there safely. Hopefully they are returning   							in a few days with more hay for the Grebes </p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-XV5RpycV1I0/T8KtiGVAROI/AAAAAAAAFb8/bT670fs0QRE/s1600-h/DSCF6774%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF6774" alt="DSCF6774" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-J6aIHVVWYEs/T8Kti_wHoVI/AAAAAAAAFcA/duyQ9mtYRo4/DSCF6774_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="414" width="525" /></a></p>
            <p>The two white ducks were back again this week so   							we dont know were one hides but it seems to come and   							go maybe it has a nest close by.</p>

    <p>There has been a lot of rabbits about this week with lots of new   			babies in Coronation Walk and surrounding areas. This one sat nice   			and still to have his picture taken</p>

    <p>The on going problem with the Grebes and swans trying to nest   			continues as the grebe try on the main bank and they stand no chance   			there as yobs will soon destroy the eggs. We desperately need some   			sort of platforms in the lake for them so they can nest safely. We   			have been asking for months but this week there is a friends meeting   			so we will ask if they  can pay for some landing stages so come   			along to the meeting.</p>

In autumn and winter, it often   							joins flocks of tits and other small birds, so if   							you come across such a flock in a wood, it is worth   							listening out for a treecreeper among them. They are   							very small and hard to see and even harder to take   							pictures of </p>

            <p>The first baby Canadian geese can be seen here   							there are four so far lets hope they have more luck   							than the swans and Grebe .</p>
            <p>We are still trying to get hay bails around the   							island so the Grebe and swans can nest in peace. The   							wildlife experts came last week and reported.</p>
            <p>Countryside service ......In the short term you   							could consider putting in a couple of floating nest   							platforms, though these would need to be situ   							ideally within the next fortnight to stand any   							chance of being used this year. Unfortunately from a   							first trawl on the internet we&rsquo;ve been unable to   							identify anything suitable &lsquo;off the peg&rsquo;. However   							you could instead consider contacting one of the   							local conservation groups who may be willing to make   							one for you. As a start try... (Contact made   							arrangements underway).<br />
            .... Short of making a very secure (human free!)   							area this is impossible to guard against, especially   							if the nests are so very accessible.... appropriate   							interpretive messages is the most cost effective   							measure, helping to engender public interest and   							help for their protection. (Signs arranged). It is   							the public&rsquo;s eyes &amp; ears that are your best weapon   							in combating such anti-social behaviours of this   							kind. (Further inspections made today by wildfowl   							specialists). </p>
            <p>So at the present time nothing has been done and   							time is running out all for a few bails of hay or   							similar </p>

            <p>Bad news on the Swans they went back to their   							nest by the bridge and laid eggs as you can see but   							latter in the week the eggs were found smashed on   							the bowling green. There are stiff penalties for   							anyone stealing eggs or hurting Swans or Grebes both   							are protected birds. The swans are now trying   							another nest but this week the Rangers are coming   							down on Tuesday to see if they can help we have   							asked for hay bails around the islands with a ramp   							so swans and grebe can bread by the island in   							safety. A Grebe laid eggs this week and in a short   							time they were taken. Its a very sad world when   							wildlife is destroyed in this way. </p>

            <p>Last week the swans built a nest by the Tipkinder   							bridge but they have abandoned it and started again   							down by the golf coarse end of the lake.

            <p>The Grebes are still about up to five some days.   							They to are trying to breed but cant find anywhere   							to do it.

            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>The nuthatch is a plump bird about the size of a   							great tit that resembles a small woodpecker. It is   							blue-grey above and whitish below, with chestnut on   							its sides and under its tail. It has a black stripe   							on its head, a long black pointed bill, and short   							legs. It breeds in central and southern England and   							in Wales, and is resident, with birds seldom   							travelling far from the woods where they hatch. </p>

            <p>Best looked for in mature woods and established   							parkland in central and southern England and Wales,   							on the sides of tree trunks and underside of   							branches. Occasional sightings in Scotland. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round. </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>

            <p>All so seen this week the peacock butterfly </p>
            <p>Peacocks hibernate through the winter and can be   							seen in the coldest winter months, although most   							individuals become active in late March and April.   							As well as being a harbinger of the coming spring,   							Peacock butterflies are interesting in many other   							ways. They are probably the longest-lived   							butterflies in Britain, with adults surviving from   							late July, well into the following spring, perhaps   							into June. Thus, contrary to popular belief that   							butterflies only live for a few days, some Peacocks   							may live to see their 11th month (albeit having   							spent five or six months of their adult lives asleep   							in hibernation).</p>
            <p><br />
              The Peacock butterfly has fared well in recent   							years. Not only has it increased in distribution,   							pushing northwards in northern England and central   							Scotland, but populations have also increased   							significantly in size at sites monitored by   							butterfly transects. It is even emerging from   							hibernation earlier than it was 20 years ago. There   							is little shortage of food for the black, spiny   							Peacock caterpillars, which feed primarily on Common   							(stinging) Nettle, and it seems highly probable that   							the good fortunes of this butterfly are due to   							climate change.</p>
            <p>Although a common visitor to garden buddleias,   							particularly in the autumn whilst building up fat   							reserves for hibernation, Peacocks are nomadic   							butterflies that range widely though the   							countryside. They often find their preferred   							breeding habitats (large nettle beds in sheltered   							but sunny situations) in the shelter of woodland   							clearings, rides and edges.</p>
            <p>The Peacock's name comes directly from that of   							its avian namesake, thanks to the similarity between   							the eye patterns on the bird's tails and those on   							the butterfly's wings. As long ago as the late   							1600s, the butterfly was called the Peacock's Eye.   							Even the scientific name of the butterfly is derived   							from a Greek myth involving a Peacock bird.</p>

            <p> All in one day this week the grebe returned. You may   							remember last year we had for the first time a   							breading pair who laid eggs but they were destroyed.   							So far we have only spotted the one grebe lets hope   							he bring his mate with him and hopefully bread this   							year.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wrn5x3M78Q4/T1K45Fz2ryI/AAAAAAAAFBg/ugW4pyb72zY/s1600-h/DSCF5544%25255B3%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF5544" alt="DSCF5544" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-hE0XYTApyBg/T1K46NNohHI/AAAAAAAAFBk/arsYuJiCG6c/DSCF5544_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="305" width="406" /></a></p>
            <p>The Barnacle goose also returned this week. It   							very strange as normally they only come in winter   							and no further south than Scotland. I think this one   							has got confused and now thinks he is a Canadian   							goose.</p>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-4mSyEbCSCxg/T1K49sY2UII/AAAAAAAAFBw/Fq3f-_tWQXI/s1600-h/DSCF4602%25255B4%25255D.jpg"> <img title="DSCF4602" alt="DSCF4602" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-6atZX0afWSw/T1K4_om4elI/AAAAAAAAFB0/G1tO2N6fBec/DSCF4602_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="433" width="430" /></a></p>
            <p>The wild life is picking up with the chaffinch   							seen below. There are lots of tits and finch   							currently in the park along with other birds. We say   							a strange site this week as a rook took a magpie out   							of the sky just like a bird of prey and he had it   							pinned down as his mate joined in luckily the magpie   							escaped </p>
            <p>The chaffinch is the UK's second commonest   							breeding bird, and is arguably the most colourful of   							the UK's finches. Its patterned plumage helps it to   							blend in when feeding on the ground and it becomes   							most obvious when it flies, revealing a flash of   							white on the wings and white outer tail feathers. It   							does not feed openly on bird feeders - it prefers to   							hop about under the bird table or under the hedge.   							You'll usually hear chaffinches before you see them,   							with their loud song and varied calls.</p>

    <p>The Grey wagtail was spotted on the lodge roof this week</p>
    <p>The grey wagtail is more colourful than its name suggests with   			slate grey upper parts and distinctive lemon yellow under-tail. Its   			tail is noticeably longer than those of pied and yellow wagtails.   			They have gradually increased their range in the past 150 years and   			in the UK have expanded into the English lowlands from the northern   			and western uplands. They are badly affected by harsh winters, and   			because of recent moderate declines it is an Amber List species. </p>
    <h5>Where to see them</h5>
    <p>Found over most of the UK, with the exception of the Northern and   			western isles of Scotland. Likes fast flowing rivers in summer their   			greatest densities are in the hills of England, Scotland and Wales.   			In winter they can be seen around farmyards and lowland streams,   			even in city centres. Scarce in central and eastern England in   			summer and from upland areas in winter. </p>

            <p>A Shovel duck made an appearance this week</p>
            <p>Shovelers are surface feeing ducks with huge   							spatulate bills. Males have dark green heads, with   							white breasts and chestnut flanks. Females are   							mottled brown. In flight birds show patches of light   							blue and green on their wings. In the UK they breed   							in southern and eastern England, especially around   							the Ouse Washes, the Humber and the North Kent   							Marshes, and in much smaller numbers in Scotland and   							western parts of England. In winter, breeding birds   							move south, and are replaced by an influx of   							continental birds from further north. The UK is home   							to more than 20% of the NW European population,   							making it an Amber List species.</p>

            <p>A new addition this week is Moor hens</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Gallinula chloropus </p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/rails.aspx"> Rails</a> (Rallidae) </p>
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>The moorhen is a medium-sized, ground-dwelling   							bird, that is usually found near water. From a   							distance it looks black with a ragged white line   							along its body. Up close it is olive-brown on the   							back and the head and underneath are blue-grey. It   							has a red bill with a yellow tip. It breeds in the   							UK in lowland areas, especially in central and   							eastern England. It is scarce in northern Scotland   							and the uplands of Wales and northern England. UK   							breeding birds are residents and seldom travel far. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>There's a chance of seeing a moorhen anywhere   							where there is water - from a small ditch or a lake   							in a city centre park, to a big lake or reservoir. </p>

            <p>We have a nesting pair with a few eggs visible in   							the nest. </p>

            <p>The legs are flattened and the toes have broad,   							leaf-like lobes, so that the forward stroke   							underwater has minimum drag but the backward stroke   							can exert maximum pressure for forward movement.  </p>
            <p>They are expert swimmers and divers but unable to   							walk on dry land. They build floating nests anchored   							to aquatic vegetation. Many other species are found   							almost worldwide </p>
            <p>They have an elaborate courtship display in which   							they rise out of the water and shake their heads.   							Very young grebes often ride on their parents'   							backs. </p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Lowland lakes, gravel pits, reservoirs and   							rivers. Also found along coasts in winter. </p>
            <h5>When to see them</h5>
            <p>All year round </p>
            <h5>What they eat</h5>
            <p>Mainly fish </p>

            <p>Spotted on the lake on Saturday this Coot. I am   							not sure exactly what type it is but its new to the   							park and if you look closely you can see its ringed   							on its leg. It doesn't appear to be a common bird in   							this area.</p>
            <h5>Latin name</h5>
            <p>Fulica atra</p>
            <h5>Family</h5>
            <p> <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/rails.aspx"> Rails</a> (Rallidae)</p>
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>All-black and larger than its cousin, the   							moorhen, it has a distinctive white beak and   							'shield' above the beak which earns it the title   							'bald'. Its feet have distinctive lobed flaps of   							skin on the toes, which act instead of webs when   							swimming. It patters noisily over the water before   							taking off and can be very aggressive towards   							others.</p>
            <h5>Where to see them</h5>
            <p>Mainly on freshwater lakes, gravel pits,   							reservoirs, rivers and town park lakes when deep   							enough. Sometimes seen offshore, especially in   							winter if freshwater areas are frozen.</p>

      I spotted the ducks in the snow and this one caught my eye its   				not our normal duck we get in the park. It looks like some sort   				of wood duck can anyone tell us what it is and is it rare in the   				Park?<br />
  <br />
      We have found out<br />
      The Duck is a Male <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/m/mandarin/index.aspx"> Mandarin</a>. Not all that rare but very nice to have in an   				urban park and not very often in this part of the world </div>

            <p>One thing happening this week that people wont   							notice is the amount of wildlife in the park with   							lots of squirrels about and lots of birds over by   							the main entrance in the bushes after the berries   							etc  all getting ready for winter.</p>

            <p>No not those sort  I Know what you thought smutty   							lot. With the bad weather the wildlife in the park   							has been in abundance as they fight  to get berries   							etc ready for winter. There are birds of all sort to   							be seen.  </p>

            <p>By Tipkinder entrance bird feeders have been   							placed and the birds are flocking to get their food.   							I spent 20 mins catching these picture and if you   							stand still just a few feet away they still come   							down to feed. These I believe are great Tits</p>
