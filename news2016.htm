                                                  <p>This   is the final report for this year I started the site in 2008 when the   restoration should have taken a year and still its not finished. Next   year they start on Coronation walk which they said would start in   September and be finished by Xmas. Now it seems it will start in the new   year when its the breeding season for lots of wildlife last time they   killed or nearly killed lots of wildlife including badgers and rabbits   and the contractors offered physical violence to  anyone complaining</p>

                                                  <p>Found   a Holly bush covered in lady birds in the park one problem these are   Harlequin ladybirds and have been declared the UK&rsquo;s fastest invading   species after reaching almost every corner of the country in just a   decade. </p>
                                                  <p>The cannibalistic ladybirds were first realised to have   reached the UK in 2004 when they were seen in Essex and have since   spread as far afield as the tip of Cornwall and the Shetland Islands,   making it the fastest alien invasion of the UK on record. Grey   squirrels, American mink, ring-necked parakeets and muntjac deer are   advancing at a rate far behind them. </p>
                                                  <p>Scientists monitoring the   spread of the voracious harlequin, which will prey on native ladybirds,   said the warnings when it first arrived that it would colonise the   country rapidly and was the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;most invasive ladybird&rdquo; have proved   correct. </p>
                                                  <p>The species is believed to be responsible for the   decline of at least seven native ladybirds, including the popular   two-spot, which when last assessed in 2012 had slumped 44%. Dr Roy said   that there has been no sign of a recovery among two-spots. </p>

Thousands of people from all   over the country are protesting in many forms from march's to direct   action supported by prominent people like<strong> Sir David Attenborough,</strong>, Chris Packham, Brian May      <br />
                                                    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NrU6WaCH_Gg/V9HpU7SYbFI/AAAAAAAARK8/zS4YVozgREc/s1600-h/clip_image0023.jpg"><img alt="clip_image002" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZAxH6aFscdQ/V9HpVWldsPI/AAAAAAAARLA/NwsLaCNiP-4/clip_image002_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image002" height="372" border="0" width="523" /></a> <br />
                                                    A note on the badger cull is worth including here; the policy is being   carried out in ten zones this year, with an upper limit of 14,213   badgers set by the licenses, and there's every indication it'll be   carried out in South Cheshire in 2017. The given reason is to tackle   bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a disease affecting cattle herds. Advocates   of badger culling participate at their peril; there's very little   scientific evidence to suggest this will help them at all, and in fact   the opposite is likely to be true in some cases. In the Randomised   Badger Culling Trial, a previous experiment that cost us 11,000+ badgers   and £50 million, the conclusion was that badger culling makes no   meaningful contribution to bTB control; in some areas of this experiment   it even increased the disease prevalence. <br />
                                                    This seems to be the situation now; bTB has increased in each of the   three cull zones from 2015 if stats from May 2015 vs May 2016 are   compared. The current cull has also cost us approximately £25 million   for approximately 4,000 badgers (none of which are tested for bTB at   all) according to DEFRA statistics reported in 'Badgered To Death', the   new book of Dominic Dyer, current CEO of The Badger Trust. Because they   aren't tested, there is absolutely no data on how prevalent the disease   is amongst the badgers that are being killed. Perhaps if they were   tested, it would make it even clearer that the disease is an issue   stemming from the poor husbandry of intensively farmed cattle,   subsequently spilling out into many wild hosts as what is essentially   industrial pollution, infecting not just badgers, but rats, hedgehogs,   otters &amp; deer as well. <br />
                                                    <strong>Warning you may find this video disturbing as badgers are often shot   and scream for a long time in agony before they die and it can be a   mother and her young will starve to death would farmers do this to their   cattle</strong>? <br />

                                                    <br />
                                                    It cost £7000 to cull a badger £300 to inoculate Under a vaccination   programme being used in Wales, around 25,000 badgers could have been   vaccinated for the same cost of killing just under 2,500 in   Gloucestershire and Somerset, according to Dyer. The badger vaccine   doesn't kill any TB but stops them infecting anything so those with TB   die leaving health badgers. The TB test for cattle is ineffective many   are killed as they show positive only to find on post mortem they were   clean it is also very painful for cows. <br />
                                                    <strong>Many if not all Badgers killed may not be infected with TB</strong>     <br />

                                                  <p>Wild Life master plan</p>
                                                  <p>A   plan for wildlife in the park was compiled with the help of visiting   experts in many fields to cover all aspects of the habitat. </p>
                                                  <p>Nesting   for wildlife on the lake is none existent we have had Grebe in the past   but these and others cant leave the water so need nesting on the lake a   simple way is to create the floating nest see <a href="http://bthbgcm.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/building-mallard-duck-nesting-tubes.html" target="_blank">http://bthbgcm.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/building-mallard-duck-nesting-tubes.html</a></p>
                                                  <p>One   year we had floating islands for the grebe and they had young all that   was used was a pallet and some straw and it worked well. The problem is   now with the boats they cant be on that side of the lake as we have seen   people in the boat reach onto the island and smash eggs. The only place   is in the middle of the fishing side which should be far enough out so   fishermen are not affected pallets around the bottom island would work   as well grebe are a protected species. Cut down trees could be used tied   together then tied to the island so it can rise and fall with the lake   plenty of old dead trees at Tipkinder You can build a floating island   very simple and cheap this also cleans the water as well as providing   nesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P28PNf2JjF0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P28PNf2JjF0</a></p>
                                                  <p>Many   of the duck struggle to bread as there is no safe /suitable place for   them to breed nesting boxes would solve that   http://norfolkwildfowl.co.uk/?p=duck.nest.boxes </p>
                                                  <p>The full answer   is to plant more suitable plants in the lake which provide natural   nesting sites provide food and improve the water for fish and wildlife<strong></strong></p>
                                                  <p>Suggested   planting along part of the edge of the lake - a fringe of reed mace,   yellow flag iris, meadowsweet and other wetland plants would create a   habitat for many creatures as well as birds (N.B. reed-mace can spread   rapidly, however it cannot move into deep water, so it should be OK in   the lake.<br />
                                                    The two steep banks of grass either side of Burma island on   the south side are never used as they are to steep and are hard to mow   so we want to cover with dense shrubs which would look nice and give   wildlife a place to bread this would help wildlife and reduce the need   for regular mowing. They could be used for fishing as it doesn&rsquo;t put   people in danger when walking past while people are casting. Possibly   the area by the main road that is a bank on the north side could have   the same treatment. The wildlife meadow on the South side has helped to   bring in insects and should be continued </p>
                                                  <p>To encourage wildlife   we need to start at the bottom of the food chain by putting lots of   compost areas and rotting log piles this needs to be balanced with not   looking a mess so it&rsquo;s a matter of agreeing areas in bushes that wont   generally be seen for these we are talking small piles which will barley   be seen not huge ones. Other discreet project are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/breathingplaces/wood_pile/">log piles</a> and <a href="https://www.opalexplorenature.org/Beehotels#/8">bee hotels</a> again discreetly situated to benefit things like hedgehogs etc. This   will fit in with school projects and we would help with an educational   resource </p>
                                                  <p>More plants are required for wildlife which would   include. More bird boxes are also needed and our members are putting up   bird feeders to feed birds through the winter.<br />
                                                    • Spring: flowering currant, Berberis, Forsythia, guelder rose.<br />
                                                    • Summer: Hebe, lavender, honeysuckle, elder<br />
                                                    • Autumn: Buddleja, heather, Hypericum, Fatsia<br />
                                                    • Winter: Mahonia, ivy, witch hazel, Sarcococca </p>
                                                  <p>Much   of the winter work is collecting leaves and transporting them this is a   natural resource which is being wasted by moving them a few feet into   the bush's they improve soil, provide things for nature and put nitrogen   back into the soil and will take half the time. A lot of bush's around   the fences are cut back in winter and in a lot of cases the denser the   area the better there is more for wildlife and it help security by   making it harder to break into the park. When that is done all around   the park railings you can see self seeded trees and these are never   touched. The ANTS could spend a day just removing self seeded trees all   over the site. </p>
                                                  <p>Since the paths have been done wildlife have   suffered as the old paths with holes had puddles for wildlife to drink   now there is only Coronation walk left all thats needed is a few small   holes that can retain water for wildlife as there is no were to get   water as the lake is too steep for a lot of wildlife bird baths would be   even better. </p>
                                                  <p><a href="http://www.trail-tech.co.uk/product-category/cameras/">Wildlife cameras</a> would be a good asset these would only be deplored as the park was   closing and retrieved at opening time so there is no problem with that   with these we could check how many badgers we check nest a class   wildlife like swans and grebe and gain information on wildlife night   life which may show wildlife we didnt know we had. They could <a href="http://www.wildviewcameras.co.uk/wildlife-cameras">be used as a security camera</a> if there were problems at night to capture intruders. You can get <a href="http://www.wildviewcameras.co.uk/birdboxes">cameras for bird boxes</a> which would be interesting to observe the birds all this goes towards   getting a better understanding of the needs of wildlife in the park. </p>
                                                  <p>Wildlife   needs promoting in the park as its a crowed puller and bring   responsible people into the park the need is there I tweet my wildlife   photos on Twitter and often they are retweeted a 1000 times so people   are interested follow on twitter @janmwright </p>

                                                  <p>Cheshire East Council&rsquo;s parks are some of the very best in the UK – and that&rsquo;s official.<strong></strong></p>
                                                  <p>Cheshire East has been awarded Green Flags for its outstanding parks. </p>
                                                  <p>The   Green Flag award is given to authorities that deliver a parks service   to an international standard. All parks are measured on how well they   are maintained, how sustainable they are along with their contributions   to conservation and heritage. </p>
                                                  <p>However, there are also more   diverse criteria that parks are measured on, which include areas such as   how they are marketed and managed. </p>
                                                  <p>Significant investment in   Queens Park, Crewe means that it now joins Congleton and Sandbach parks   along with the Moor in Knutsford, Bollington recreation ground, Brereton   Heath local nature reserve, Tegg&rsquo;s Nose country park and Tatton Park as   having been awarded the Green Flag standard. </p>
                                                  <p>Tatton Park has   also received the Green Heritage Award, which is given to places that   achieve a high standard in management and interpretation of a site with   local or national historic importance. </p>
                                                  <p>The awards were   recognition of outstanding partnership working both with other local   authorities and community groups. They were given out at Sheffield Town   Hall in an event attended by many northern authorities. </p>
                                                  <p>Councillor   David Brown, Deputy Leader of Cheshire East Council, said: &ldquo;This is   deserved recognition for a lot of hard work and dedication, not just   from our own teams at Cheshire East but also the army of volunteers and   community groups that make achievements like this possible.&rdquo; </p>
                                                  <p>&ldquo;The   Green Flag is an international standard and the only national award for   parks, so this is great praise for Cheshire East to be recognised in   this way.&rdquo; </p>
                                                  <p>Councillor John Hammond, Chairman of Ansa – who   deliver parks services for Cheshire East – said: &ldquo;Green Flag is a   prestigious parks award which benchmarks the national standard for parks   and green spaces in the UK. So I am delighted with this success. </p>
                                                  <p>&ldquo;All   of these parks look beautiful at this time and I must thank all our   friends groups and partners for their outstanding efforts and   contributions to make this happen.  </p>
                                                  <p>&ldquo;It was particularly   satisfying that Queens Park in Crewe, was successful in obtaining the   award this year, following the recent refurbishment and investment. We   do hope you will take time to visit and support your local park!&rdquo; </p>

                                                  <p>After   problems with the illegal disturbing of badgers we were assured by the   Chief Exec that they would be looked after as required by law </p>
                                                  <p>I quote from the letter from Peter Bates 17th June 2016:<br />
                                                    &ldquo;The   latest incident you describe with the mowing was a result of the badger   sett expanding into the open grassland and not being spotted by our   staff.&rdquo; <br />
                                                    We are disappointed that this has happened again since we hoped that staff would now be <br />
                                                    well informed and subsequently give the sett a wide birth with the mower. </p>
                                                  <p> But this week they went over setts with a mower this is not only a   problem for badgers but it show CEC has no concept of safety of its   staff if a mower drop down a hole and its ride on then the operator can   be thrown off and with blades spinning be seriously hurt. There seems to   be no communication from the top to staff on the ground  </p>

                                                  <p>I   was very luck to be able to stop all the badgers being chopped into   little pieces this week as a very large tractor was on site mowing and   was going over setts with the grass cutting disks. I shouted at the man   and stopped him but he had run over one sett before I got to him. I   explained it was a criminal offence to disturb badgers the second time   in a few months they have done this and once again it was reported to   the Police as a wildlife crime. The offence has started a outrage on   Facebook from badger groups in the area. A local group has now been   formed to protect the badgers in the park and they will check them on a   regular basis. Many have come through out the week to see that they are   ok and a survey was done over the weekend were more setts were found in   hard to get to places.  If you would like to join the group and keep the   badgers safe contact me </p>

                                                  <p>Over   the weekend the Air Ambulance was called out to the park as a 11 year   old boy had fallen from the Broadwalk bridge. He had been climbing on   the bridge when he fell. We are glad to hear he is ok as he could have   died falling some 30 ft onto rocks. The problem is there is no way to   stop this you often see children walking on the out side of the bridge   or climbing up the arch and its only a matter of time before someone   dies. They should have saved £250,000 and just looped the path like they   have done near the lake.</p>

                                      <p>The badgers safety has become a criminal issue as CEC and   employees fail to take action and the Police investigate a wildlife   crime? Below is details of the complaint to the council and there   response the writing in red is my response to CEC s response. Several   Badger groups have provided advice and shared there knowledge on the   matter  </p>
                                      <p>I wish to take this to the next level before referring   it to the Ombudsman. The case is a very serious one as I believe its a   criminal offence that has been committed and may be committed again if   actions isnt taken. The Police have taken statement and evidence and a   criminal prosecution may follow if work continues without a survey and   any required licences more crime may take place </p>
                                      <p>The path went   through planning without ecological survey and knowing the diverse   wildlife in the park it should have never passed planning without the   survey. </p>
                                      <p>Whoever did the planning application failed to get a survey </p>
                                      <p>They   were advised on 23rd November about badgers and its recorded   http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2015/11/paths-are-under-way.html. </p>
                                      <p>The   environmental officer was told again in January and its recorded   http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2016/01/have-cec-illegally-killed-badgers.html </p>
                                      <p>A unqualified person then checked he proved he is unqualified as   he thought it was rabbits. He took no action and didn't order a survey   or stop work in the area. </p>
                                      <p>The environmental officer was informed   last week that a criminal act was taking place and he took no action to   immediately stop it. </p>
                                      <p>The contactors were also informed and refused to take action. </p>
                                      <p>George   Broughton was told and could have taken action but didnt instead of   ringing and stopping work he took his time coming to the park. </p>
                                      <p>Having   established there were badgers active no one ordered a survey or took   any action to ensure their safety or tried to obtain a licence as is   required. </p>
                                      <p>Work is going on in other areas and more criminal acts   may take place if a survey isnt taken and worked stopped until its   declared safe. </p>
                                      <p>The Police are investigating it as a criminal wildlife crime. </p>
                                      <p>I   believe this shows gross mismanagement and needs investigating at the   highest level 5 badger groups have looked at this and all believe its a   criminal offence </p>
                                      <p>CEC response to original complaint </p>
                                      <p>Starting   on site in November 2015, a long awaited project is being delivered to   renew the pathways around Queens Park. This is one of the final elements   of the whole park restoration that the council have been working on in   partnership with our Friends Group. The plans received both Planning   Consent and Listed Building Consent. At the time of the project   planning, badgers were not known to be present in the park. There were   plenty of visible animal excavations but this was thought to be by   rabbits. The first indication that badgers might be present was reported   on 1st February 2016. On immediate inspection there was no evidence observed of Badger activity. </p>
                                      <p><strong><em>This   is total incompetence first badger have been in the park for years and   all staff know about them pity management dont. Rabbit and badger hole   are totally different so again its something they should know. Have been   advised they should then have called and ecologist to check if you   think a sett is unused you have to prove it normally by using cameras   over a 3 week period. If badgers are present then a ecological survey   needs to be done and planning shouldnt have pasted it until its done.   They would have then had to apply for a licence which wouldnt be issued   as its breeding season </em></strong><strong></strong></p>
                                      <p>Following a further report by a member of the Friends of Queens Park, the site was revisited on 14th   March 2016.  This time evidence was found of badger activity in the   vicinity of our path works. There was a marked change in the scale of   the diggings in two holes; one was obviously more active than the   other.  This time signs were very different observing badger paw prints   and found badger hair making this pretty conclusive evidence. This   evidence was not apparent when visiting the same location six weeks ago. </p>
                                      <p><strong><em>It wasnt reported by the friend it   was reported by myself to the environmental office Mr Bagley who failed   to visit the site and take appropriate action </em></strong><strong></strong></p>
                                      <p>However,   whilst there has been some path work close to the sett, there has been   no path associated excavation activity near the holes under the   shrubbery where these holes are located. The holes are located at the   base of large Holly trees within the shrubbery, the entrances being   directly under the roots of the trees into the higher part of the bank   on the park perimetre. </p>
                                      <p><strong><em> A badger sett can be 310 meters long so using heavy machinery in the area could collapse the sett in the breading season. </em></strong></p>
                                      <p>The   path works undertaken are not impacting the shrubbery. The path   construction works entailed the old path surface being scraped in   preparation for relaying. This was on the surface but not impacting   below the existing ground level. The level of the new path was being   raised up from that existing base ready for a new more DDA compliant   path being laid out over the top. The construction contractors   stockpiled the sub-soil / clay required for the reprofiling work in the   vicinity of the shrubbery edge but did not cover the entrance of these   holes which are behind the shrubs. This sub-soil has now been removed   and used under the new path, the new path edges have been tidied up   using topsoil which has been hand raked into position and has now been   seeded with grass-seed to the edge of the shrubbery. </p>
                                      <p> So they   admit they dumped tons of hard clay using a heavy dump truck which   actually covered and entrance which was the main one thats why the   others didnt show signs of use until they blocked the main one, the   heavy dump truck would disturb breeding badgers and could collapse the   sett. As the sett could be 310 meters then the path could effect it and a   licence was required </p>
                                      <p>The entrance to the sett is located beneath   the evergreen shrubs. The path edge is beyond the left hand edge of the   photograph. The extent of the badger spoil can be seen at the top of   the shadow. What is visible is the adjacent new topsoil that has been   spread along the edge of the path. This topsoil is being seeded with   grass-seed. </p>
                                      <p>During the planning of this project badgers were not   considered as a risk as they were not known to be in the park. As soon   as their potential presence was suggested officers immediately went to   investigate and found nothing to suggest disturbance to the badger sett.   The method of construction of the new path has not required any   excavation close to the badger holes so the only disturbance has been   vehicle movements along the path which , given the proximity of the   perimeter road, disturbance would be minimal . Whilst soil has been   deposited close to the holes, the impact of this is negligible and now   at an end.   </p>
                                      <p>I did call Mr Wright on Monday prior to visiting the   park. At the scene I spoke to some of the contractors who were   spreading top-soil with rakes in the vicinity of the badger holes. </p>
                                      <p>The   path work in that area is now complete so there will not be any further   chance of disturbance from this project. The Badger holes are now being   monitored to check that the badgers remain undisturbed. </p>
                                      <p>The advice on working close to a Badger Sett is found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/badgers-protection-surveys-and-licences">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/badgers-protection-surveys-and-licences</a> . The guidance states: </p>
                                      <p>You usually won&rsquo;t need a licence to do the following if it&rsquo;s unlikely to disturb a badger in its sett: </p>
                                      <p>        work with hand tools or machinery above or below ground close to a sett </p>
                                      <p>        clear vegetation near setts, including felling small trees or shrubs </p>
                                      <p>        clear ditches and watercourses using hand tools or machinery </p>
                                      <p>The   Council takes its responsibilities for protecting wildlife very   seriously and we are satisfied that our actions on this project have not   exceeded what is permitted.  The presence of badgers will now be   factored into any future projects in Queens Park. </p>
                                      <p><strong><em> He   has highlighted the rules and yes you can work with hand tools within   the area only when you apply for a licence and are then advised its not   needed. Before telling lies one should first check there isnt video ,   photos and witness to the fact they used a digger and he admits they   used a dump truck to dump tones of heavy clay within a foot of the sett   which makes it a wildlife crime and it has been reported to the Police   as such. Having found there were badgers they were duty bound to get a   ecologist and not some random worker who cant tell a rabbit hole from a   badger sett. They should then have told contractors to not use heavy   machines within at least 20ft ( contractors claim they were never told   about badgers)</em></strong></p>
                                      <p><strong><em>There   was no reason whatsoever to use a digger to spread soil near badgers it   could have been done within the law and used a wheel barrow or even left   it until the breeding season is over.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>
                                      <p>The new paths will allow the whole community to enjoy the diverse wildlife found in Queens Park. </p>

                              <div> After problems with the badgers in the Queens Park Crewe  were Cheshire east Council are redoing paths.  I saw on Sunday that work was going on close  to the sett. I emailed  the council  leader rachel.bailey@cheshireeast.gov.uk and the portfolio holder sam.gardner@cheshireeast.gov.uk  and advised to stop the work in the area of the badgers I have had no reply  from them.</div>

You can see how close they have got to the sett with the new soil even right under the bush <br />

<div> On Monday morning I rang the Mr Bagley the environmental  officer  for the council and advised him  that work should be stopped and pointed him to evidence that the sett was very  active. He said he would phone George Broughton   who was in charge of the project and get him to ring me back as a matter  of urgency which he didnt.</div>
<div> I arrived at the park at 1 pm only to find they were using a  digger to move soil onto the badger sett it being wrong to use heavy digger  with 10 mtrs of an active sett. I rang Ian at the contractors </div>

  Telephone: 01948 663014<br />
  E-mail: <a href="mailto:info@pronin.co.uk">info@pronin.co.uk</a></div>
<div> I explained as wildlife crime was being committed by his  staff and asked him to stop the work he wasn't in the slightest interested and  refused to take any action to stop this criminal activity. If your thinking of  employing this firm you may want to consider this attitude. I have rang them  since and they refuse to answer me. His staff claimed in the park they hadnt  used a digger until I told them I had it on video and photos.  He is guilty as one quick phone call could  have stop the crime which he failed to do.</div>
<div> I rang Mr. Bagley as a matter of urgency  he got George to ring me and he said he would  attend in 30 mins  he claimed he had rang  me several times with no answer but my logs show no calls.  I waited with others for over an hour and a  half and by this time the work men had done the crime and moved on. I believe  that George and Mr Bagley stalled doing anything so the job would be finished  before they got there it would have taken only mins for them to ring and have  the job stopped.</div>
<div> <br />
</div>
<div> George claimed he had looked at the sett when I complained  before about illegal activity weeks ago and he believed the sett wasnt used.  see http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2016/01/have-cec-illegally-killed-badgers.html   He is not qualified to make that  decision only an ecologist can say that and they must by law prove it not used  by cameras etc over a period of 3+ weeks.</div>
<div> <br />
</div>
<div>  What George should  have done is stop any work in the area its not vital work so there is no  urgency. He should have then called a qualified ecologist to carry out a  survey.</div>
<div> Question now need to be answered why did this project get  past planning without a ecologist survey in the first place that is a fault  with planning and a mis managment of planning. </div>
<div> <br />
</div>
<div> To work so close to badger they need a licence and being  breading season they wouldnt get one why didnt they not get a licence who is responsible?</div>
<div> <br />
</div>
<div> The concern is now there are other setts in the park with  work planned a few feet from the setts will they continue to flout the law and  disturb or kill the badgers? </div>
<div> <br />
</div>
<div> I have complained to the council who have assigned it to the  park manager who wont be able to investigate her senior manager George or the  planning committee.</div>
<div> <br />
</div>
<div> The matter has been reported to the Cheshire Police as a  wildlife crime  </div>

                                <p>We   reported a few weeks ago of the CEC contractors committing a criminal   act by disturbing a badger sett without a licence. It was investigated   and CEC claimed the sett was unused but by law they have to prove that   which they didnt they showed a photo of the sett covered in leaves which   was strange as that sort of leaves are not in  that area. So it looks   like a cover up. You can see from the photos that the sett has had   massive amounts of soil dug out by the badgers and is the classic D   shape hole so its very active. If you look close at full image you can   make out badger foot prints. The contractors have been doing work very   close to the sett and by law must only use hand tools within 10 ft of   the sett this hasn't happened they have illegally used machines. So he   will be prosecuted?  You can see in the photo evidence of bottles etc on   the sett as if workmen have been sitting on it</p>

                                <p>Work near active badger setts must be carried out between July and </p>
                                <p>November inclusive, to avoid the disturbance of breeding female badgers. </p>
                                <p>Badger tunnels can extend up to 20 metres from the entrance holes and are </p>
                                <p>located between 0.2 metres and several metres deep, depending on the soil </p>
                                <p>and topography. Excavation work and heavy machinery must be kept well </p>
                                <p>away from where it could result in damage to the sett or disturbance to any </p>
                                <p>badger occupying the sett. </p>
                                <p>All works within 10 metres of the nearest sett entrance must be undertaken using hand tools only. </p>

                                <p>The   environment agency acted by bringing a massive pump to pump out the   lake as they couldn't move the tree blocking the gate as all the water   was falling making it dangerous  </p>

                                      <p>Heres   a mystery we complained that when doing the paths they had illegally   interfered with a badges set which is a criminal offence. The council   then said the whole wasnt used as it was stuffed with leaves which was   very strange as there were no leaves in the area. But today you can see   its very much used just look at all the soil thats been dug out in the   last week or so. If people have put the leaves there blocking the hole   its a criminal offence and they should be prosecuted </p>

Last week we reported how they   destroyed the main rabbit warren. I advised about them getting close a   few weeks ago on the site but CEC seem to have no regards for nature or   wildlife and the parks wildlife group are a failure not taking action on   this matter. How many more wildlife die as a result of their actions?   Even if this was a fox den its still illegal to cover it You can report   badger offencies <a title="http://badger.org.uk/threats/report-a-dead-badger.aspx" href="http://badger.org.uk/threats/report-a-dead-badger.aspx">http://badger.org.uk/threats/report-a-dead-badger.aspx</a></p>

                                      <p>Over   a century after the mysterious Lost Carnival disappeared, news has   reached our ears that The Lost Carnival will appear at Queen&rsquo;s Park in   Crewe this May. <strong>For three short nights only, families will step into a   world unlike any other in this large-scale outdoor immersive theatre   experience from award-winning producers Wild Rumpus (Just So Festival)   and So It Is (Bury Met, Ramsbottom Festival).</strong></p>

                                      <p>Every year, as summer arrives and   the evenings grow longer, The Lost Carnival will appear in a different   locality. The Lost Carnival in Crewe is the second Lost Carnival event <strong>with a limited amount of early bird tickets on sale now. </strong></p>
                                      <p><strong></strong></p>

A place rooted in the railways, a   meeting point, what better place for the two greatest carnival rivals to   come together once again? </p>

But things are not always as they seem.   Keep your eyes peeled on Facebook and Twitter as Popou Ingenue and   Sergei Bird vie for your affections. It's time to pin your colours to   the mast. #teamingenue or #teambird?  </p>

Look out for and meet curious characters popping up in locations   across Crewe throughout May. Take part throughout the evening and   witness a thrilling culmination if you dare. </p>

                                    <p>You   now cant get to the lake to feed the ducks the path to the bridge is   closed and all that area is shut off. The wildlife are wandering about   as they are not getting any food. Wild life doesnt count as far as CEC   is concerned they could have fenced off closer to the lake so people   could give food to the ducks over the fence. Better still finish the   south side and open that up then close the other side</p>

                                    <p>Once   again for no good reason they are chopping down trees this one has been   there for years so there is no reason to cut it down the path goes past   it. Its the same as the south side were they claimed it was for the   paths but the path route hasnt changed. At one time if you chopped a   tree down you had to have good reason and had to plant a new one</p>

                        <p>I   started this website in 2009 it was going to be a 1-2 year project to   turn the park back into the Jewell in the Crown it used to be. Here we   are over 6 years later and still its not finished. The paths are being   done at the present time but they don't include coronation walk which   was one of the best parts of the park. Still to be done is Burma Island   remove the old workshops and tidy the mess around there. We still have   no warden and as such dogs roam off the lead with no one to stop them. </p>
                        <p>The   gardens are struggling to cope with the work and basically fighting   fires and are not able to create anything new or even maintain half the   site. The islands were tidy and then the wildlife group took them over   and now they are a disgrace just covered in weeds as the group hasn't   touched them in over a year. They have had a lot of money for wildlife   but spent hardly any. One of the side effects of doing the paths is to   make it harder for wildlife as at present they can get water in puddles   but may have no water they cant drink from the lake as its too deep. The   wildlife group need to spend the money to provide drinking areas for   wildlife the money is doing no good in the bank it needs spending for   the benefit of wildlife. So will I still be here next year waiting for   the park to be finished? </p>
