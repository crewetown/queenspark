        A HERITAGE WALK AROUND   					QUEENS PARK, CREWE<br />
        by Howard Curran July 1997<br />
        <br />
        
        <div> 
          <p align="justify">An 1882 map of the area shows farmlands straggling the   						River Waldron (Valley Brook) covering almost 11 fields,   						these fields consisting of nearly 50 acres of land would   						eventually be the nucleus of the Park. The river which   						meandered peacefully through these farmlands, would one   						day flow into a newly constructed lake.<br />
            How fortunate that over forty years earlier that the   						railway company instead of building their line to   						Chester across these pastures, chose a more northerly   						route through Coppenhall Hayes. Otherwise these fields   						which are now Queens Park would have been lost in   						providing the Crewe to Chester line.<br />
            <br />
            However, because a different route was chosen, work was   						able to commence in 1882 on this &quot;Victorian&quot; Park, being   						designed by Francis William Webb and Edward Kemp. They   						enlisted the expertise of George Latimer, a forester by   						trade, who would become the first Park Curator (1888 -   						1906). He experimented with his forestry knowledge by   						planting many different types of trees, which now add   						greatly to the charm and attraction of the Park. ; To   						enable this Park to be constructed, Webb had used his   						influence with the Chairman of the Railway Company (Sir   						Richard Moon) to acquire the necessary 50 acres of   						Company land and £10,000 to build the Park.<br />
            <br />
            It was anticipated that the Park would be completed in   						time for the celebrations of Queen Victoria's Jubilee   						and Crewe's own Jubilee celebration. On 4th July 1887,   						exactly 50 years after the first train had stopped at   						Crewe, there was great rejoicing in the town to   						commemorate Queen Victoria's 50 years, especially at the   						dedication of Queens Park.<br />
            The actual opening ceremony would take place 12 months   						later by HRH The Duke of Cambridge KG on Saturday 9th   						June 1888. For this ceremony, as well as the Duke of   						Cambridge, there were Sir Richard Moon, Francis William   						j Webb, Frederick Cook (Town Clerk), many other   						dignitaries and the driver of the first train into   						Crewe, James Middleton.<br />
            <br />
            It has been rumoured over the years that the LNWR   						Company gave the land to stop the GWR Company building a   						station in the area. This is very hard to establish all   						one can say is the nearest GWR line is over two miles   						away at Shavineton and why build a line over a mile from   						the centre of Crewe? The one thing that is for sure is   						that in the Director's Minute Book of the LNWR for 1886,   						it refers to this area being given for the use of a   						public park. I suppose some things we will never know.   						The only certain thing is that in Sir Richard Moon's   						dedication speech in giving the Park to the people of   						Crewe, he said &quot;that he hoped that the Park would bring   						pleasure and happiness to the community for generations   						to come&quot;. That I feel without any doubt has been   						achieved.</p>

            <strong>The Park Lodge Gates</strong><br />
            <br />
            There are four gates - east, west, south and the main   						gate. The main gates are supported by four red sandstone   						gateposts. Each post has emblems surmounted upon them.   						The gates themselves are very impressive, made in   						ornamental ironwork. The two side gates have the date of   						the dedication (1887) moulded into the ironwork, whilst   						the main gate is surmounted by a royal crown.<br />
            </p>
          <hr />
          <p align="justify"><br />
            <strong>The Park Lodges</strong><br />
            <br />
            On either side of the gates are the two lodges built   						1887'8 by John Brooke They are<br />
            constructed in Stone and timber' the stone being of red   						sandstone, extracted from railway<br />
            cutting that go down Lime St Station Liverpool. The   						inscription at first floor level on both lodges   						commemorate both the dedication and opening ceremonies.   						Both lodges are buildings of special architectural and   						historical interest therefore they are both Grade 2   						listed buildings.<br />
            <br />
            Not an identical pair, the West Lodge has a Bell Tower   						and was for use by the chief foreman in charge of the   						gardeners. Whilst the East Lodge was built for the   						Park's Curator. Incidentally, there have only been four   						Park Curators in the Park's history. The four curators   						are&gt;<br />
            Ceorge Latimer 1888 - 1906<br />
            Lawrence Morgan 1906 -1935<br />
            Herbert Probert 1935 -1960<br />
            Colin Farmer 1960 -1984<br />
            (After 1984 the system was changed, with the park being   						looked after under a different  						scheme).</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In the apex of the roof on both lodges facing Victoria   						Avenue are two unique witticisms on the two people who   						the park owes its very existence to. On the east lodge   						is a painting of a bat, moon and tree in yellow and   						green. A pun to Sir Richard Moon, Chairman of the LNWR   						Company. Whilst the west lodge has a spider's web, a   						tree and a spider, a pun on Francis William Webb.</p>

              <strong>The Jubilee Clock</strong><br />
              <br />
              On entrance into the Park down Central Drive from the   						gates stands the impressive Jubilee Clock. Donated by   						the employees of the Railway Company and built in 1888.   						The tower has four large clock faces surmounted by an   						elaborate support for the weather vane. The tower is a   						Grade 2 listed building and is of stone and brick   						construction. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Clearly it can be seen within the ornate sandstone and   						the faces of Queen Victoria (facing  						north), the Duke of Cambridge (facing south), Sir   						Richard Moon (facing east, towards the  						Curator's Lodge which contains his pun) and Francis   						William Webb (facing west towards the Lodge with his pun   						upon it). At the rear of the clock is a cast iron plaque   						explaining how the clock tower was donated by the   						employees of the Company and unveiled by James Middlelon.   						Middleton was given this honour for fifty years service   						to the Company, quite an impressive achievement. Even   						more impressive when its realized that Middleton was the   						driver of the first train that stopped at Crewe on the   						4th July 1837.</p>

              <strong>The South African   						Memorial</strong><br />
              <br />
              Continuing along Central Drive, built for horse drawn   						carriages, the South African Memorial stands   						impressively in front of the Pavilion. Flanked by a   						sloping bedding display the statue is 31ft high and made   						of Labrador and Aberdeen Grey granite. Topped by the   						life-like figure of Tommy Atkins. The north facing side   						is the only place where the former Arms of the Borough   						with the moto &quot;<em><strong>Never Behind&quot;</strong></em> can still be seen.<br />
              <br />
              The Copper bronze plaques on the four sides of the   						monument give the names of the railway volunteers who   						served in the Boer War (1899 - 1902). Crewe can quite   						rightly feel proud that through the railway volunteers   						they were able to send more men to the Boer War than any   						other town in England or Wales of comparable size.<br />

              <strong>The Jubilee Pavilion</strong><br />

              The Cafeteria standing behind the Memorial is aptly   						named the Jubilee Cafeteria to commemorate the Jubilee   						of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, being officially   						opened on 12th June 1977.<br />
              <br />
              This modem structure along with the bandstand was built   						to replace the Victorian Pavilion which unfortunately   						had burnt down. The front page of Crewe Chronicle told   						the sorry tale about the original Pavilion on Thursday   						4th January 1973 with the following report. A Senior   						Fire Officer told the Chronicle that possibly an   						electrical fault was the cause of the fire, early on   						Friday morning, 29th December 1972, that had destroyed   						the Park Pavilion.<br />
              To make matters worse, it seems that water mains had   						been fractured by frost and, although firemen pumped   						water from the lake, it was to no avail and by the grey   						light of dawn very little was left of the 1887 Pavilion.<br />

            <p>At the rear of the Cafeteria where the two paths combine   						with the main path, overlooking the lake, a fossilized   						tree can be found. It is said that this tree dates back   						to the Devonian  						period, some 320 million years ago. It is reputed to be   						the remains of a tulip tree, a<br />
              Lepidodendron, turned to stone through fossilisation.   						This fossilized tree being given to the Park by John   						Knott when he was Mayor of Crewe in 1888/9.<br />

          <p align="justify"><strong>The Lake</strong><br />
            <br />
            An exceptional feature of the Park is the extensively   						landscaped man-made lake. The lake was created by the   						use of a dam on the west side of the River Waldron   						(Valley Brook) way back in 1883 flooding about five   						acres of land. As well as the creation of a dam, an area   						around the River Waldron to a depth of about five feet   						was dug out. Then by the method of &quot;puddling&quot; the clay,   						the bottom was made water-tight.<br />
            <br />
            For just about 30 years the river flowed through the   						lake creating, I hasten to add, a few problems. The   						river over these early years brought many tons of silt,   						making problems along the banks of the lake. By 1913,   						the decision to culvert the river trying to alleviate   						these troubles was taken, so from that date the river   						flowed underneath the lake.<br />
            <br />
            The Lake loses water on a regular basis through   						evaporation and leakage. Therefore, what better method   						is there than using the river to refill it. A wormscrew   						made in Crewe Works back 1913, still in constant use,   						enables that to happen. The River Waldron by the use of   						sluice gates can be diverted to refill the lake.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One of the benefits that culverting achieved was that   						the Lake became cleaner, resulting in it being used by   						locals for swimming. In fact the west side of the lake   						was deepened to ten foot. This enabled diving boards to   						be constructed which were in constant use until their   						removal in 1936.</p>

            <strong>Burma Star Island</strong><br />
          <br />
          In 1968 an island in the middle of the lake, accessible   						by two bridges, was extensively relandscaped and had new   						paths and seating positioned. Then on the 26th May 1968   						at a service conducted by the Lord Bishop of Chester,   						the Rt Rev G A Ellison DD, the island was dedicated as a   						permanent Memorial to the Allied Forces who fought in   						the Burma Campaign during World War 2. The Memorial   						Stone, brought from excavations at ICI Works Runcorn,   						has the famous Kohima epitath:-<br />

          <p><strong>History of the Trees<br />
            </strong><br />
            It is reputed that there are only five trees to remind   						everyone of the hedgerows from the fields of the   						original farmlands of over a hundred years ago. They are   						of course all Oak, three are by the play area, whilst two   						more are near the Aviary. Most of the trees within the   						Park have been planted under the guidance of the four   						Park Curators. Obviously many were planted when the Park   						was First being created, for instance, the giant   						Atlantic Cedars. Many of the trees which have been   						planted by successive Curators over the last 40 or 50   						years are now reaching maturity, so its these people to   						thank for such a remarkable array of trees within the   						Park.<br />
            <br />
            I am reliably informed there is in excess of 100   						species, ranging from Oak, Ash, Beech, Conifers, Yews,   						Irish Yews, as well as Laburnum and some beautiful   						scented Hawthorns. Most trees that readily come to mind   						one could find within the Park, far too many I hasten to   						add for me to mention. Of course there are many unique   						trees, like the twisted Willow, the Canadian Balsam and   						my favourite, the Cedar of Lebanon, nicknamed the   						&quot;monkey tree&quot; by generations of Crewe children.<br />

            <strong>Coronation Walk</strong><br />
            <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/Siw_pyFeWJI/AAAAAAAAApk/ZqdozX1cjqc/s1600-h/coranation.jpg"> <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_STF1x2d9m_o/Siw_pyFeWJI/AAAAAAAAApk/ZqdozX1cjqc/s400/coranation.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5344716844833855634" border="0" /></a><br />
            The walk runs from the lake back to the foot of the main   						entrance. Designed in 1935 by Herbert Probert, it is a   						superb landscaped valley complete with an artificial   						stream, it holds many surprises. Thought at the time of   						construction it might possibly be named the Francis Webb   						Memorial Garden it was eventually called Coronation Walk   						in 1937.<br />
            Along the path a visit to the Aviary is a must.   						Originally built in 1937 through the efforts  						of Councillor Mrs Mossford Powell (incidentally, Mrs   						Mossford Powell lived at Coppenhall  						Hayes, on the spot where Station House now stands in   						Victoria Avenue). The first boathouse was being pulled   						down in 1937 so she donated money to enable it to be   						converted into the first Aviary.<br />
            <br />
            A large stone that stands by the Aviary is the oldest   						piece of history in Crewe. It originates  						from the first glacial age and goes back some 500   						million years. It is a piece of Aberdeen  						granite and was washed down in that period of time. It   						was discovered when the Foundations for part of the   						original Company Works was being excavated.<br />
            I hope this Heritage Walk around Queens Park has enabled   						everyone to appreciate many of the hidden charms of this   						superb Park. It has been said in the past and I don't   						mind repeating it,<br />
            <strong><br />
            &quot;This Park is without doubt the Jewel in the Crown&quot;.</strong></p>
