        <p>The   swans are getting white now the females more so than the males.   Concerns this week as to how they have been tamed and if you dont know   and feed them they eat out of your hand problem was one women had a baby   with her and they frightened the mother as she thought they were   attacking the baby. If they one do it for food if you have a baby it can   happen they attack by accident </p>

        <p>Goosanders   in the park starting with one then today Mondays we had four of them.   These handsome diving ducks are a member of the sawbill family, so   called because of their long, serrated bills, used for catching fish. A   largely freshwater bird, the goosander first bred in the UK in 1871. It   built up numbers in Scotland and then since 1970 it has spread across   northern England into Wales, reaching south-west England. Its love of   salmon and trout has brought it into conflict with fishermen. It is   gregarious, forming into flocks of several thousand in some parts of   Europe</p>

      <div id="post-body-7398850709729075083" itemprop="description articleBody">
        <p>When is a wildlife group not a wildlife group? That is a good   question as the Queens Park wildlife group doesnt in fact seem to be   there for wildlife. The leader of the group was asked if she would be   helping the birds of the park through the winter by providing nuts bird   feeders etc its reported that on Face Book she replied that the birds   can go and fly away and get food but the swans cant eat without me.</p>
        <p>If   its a proper wildlife group then it should be working for all wildlife   from hedgehogs squirrels and all the birds in the park isnt it the point   of a wildlife group to try and get as much wildlife in the park as   possible by providing the right environment for them to flourish. Not to   just concentrate on swans as that then makes them a swan group not a   wildlife group and by using the wrong name and suggesting they are for   all wildlife the may be obtaining money and support under false   pretences.</p>
        <p>The group has become controversial and many of the   original group have left due to the aggressive nature of the leader  and   the fact despite being told by many people that  feeding the swans by   hand with a dog with you is putting them in danger as we witnessed this   week when a dog off the lead went up to them and they thought it was   food. Experts have said they will think a dog is friendly now and will   learn to late that they kill lots of swans. The same is true of people   as a lot of swans end up on the Xmas table and these are so simple to   catch but the leader refuses to listen. She sees the swans as HER pets   not as wildlife who need to learn to survive in the wild all wildlife   hospitals etc keep human contact to the minimum for any sort of wildlife   that will go back in the wild. The leader refuses to listen to even   experts with years of experience and is putting them in danger.</p>
        <p>There   are a great deal of people who feed the wildlife in the park and have   for years but these have now been split with a gang like culture of if   your in my gang you dont speak to others. The Face book page is now a   closed group so its activities can be done in secret and anyone   disagreeing with the leader are quickly axed  and her gang wont speak to   them. Several people have complained about the leader aggressive nature   telling them off for feeding the swans</p>

              <p>Lots   of nice winter colour which as its so mild should be Autumn colour. You   would expect most trees to have lost their leaves by now but there   hanging on but changing almost daily </p>

              <p>The   Friends AGM took place recently were members are voted in for yet   another 3 years as no one else turns up they all vote each other in yet   again. I did find this interesting and I quote</p>
              <p>This time last   year the Chair stated we would be starting the paths; it is   disappointing this has not happened, however the budget is there and   waiting to go -- the only delay is ongoing consultation with English   Heritage and our Planning officers –this should be resolved soon.   Hopefully, the work will start on site before Spring next year. </p>
              <p>It   tell us the old old story time again last year they said it would be   done in spring then they said it would be August now its next year will   it ever get done? Last year they stated that Burma Island would be done   by Xmas 18 months later nothing has happened its the same story with   Coronation Walk no sign of that being done will the park ever be   finished after all these years you could have built a new one.</p>

              <p>In   2011 the £650,000 bowling hut was finished built from scratch and brand   new. Now after just 2 years the renovation is having to be renovated   all the panelling on the hut has had to be replaced. People should be   asking serious question why after £7million has been spent on the park   they are having to renovate a brand new hut? If you buy a kettle or tv a   lot come with over 2 years warranty wouldn't you expect a hut at this   price to have an even longer one?   </p>
              <p>The next renovation of a   renovation is the cafe as the veranda will have to be replaced again   after a 2 year period. Why was it signed off as a completed job if it   was going to fall apart after such a short space of time. I get lots of   complaints about the hut as its a lot of money to spend on a few   individual's as its cant be used by the general public as it used to be.   At one time you could go an rent bowls and have a game now the hut is   standing empty for most of the week. The council seem to like paying   money out for small select groups instead of getting the park paths etc   restored. The fishing is the same only a few anglers use the lake on a   regular basis but they get money spent on them and the general public   have to walk around on dangerous paths. The paths they promised would be   done in April this year and we are still waiting for them to even start   when they do it will be the worse time in winter when it makes it very   hard to do.   </p>

              <p>The   park now has all sort of volunteer groups including ANTS, Wildlife,   Fishing and Friends. The whole scheme is just chaos and these groups   dont seem to understand what they are doing is a waste of time. The ANTS   have turned up lots of times and done stuff which is a total waste of   peoples time. Above they tidied the lodge garden and in the process   removed some old rare plants as they have no knowledge. But time and   time again they make the same mistakes they cleaned it and thats it as   you can see above the weeds are back so all the time they spent cleaning   is just a waste of time. They do the same in coronation walk    they   tidy it up then never go back for a month or so in which time its its a   wilderness again so their time is wasted, the gulf war they planted   bushes and left them to die and the border full of weeds.</p>
              <p>If they   came in every time and just kept 3 areas clean it would stay clean and   be improved not revert to a wilderness they could renovate one area and   then they could come back and show we have done that as it is when they   come back its just wild again as it was before they started. If they are   not going to do it properly then leaving it rough for wildlife is a   better option.</p>
              <p>All these groups are getting out of hand and   potentially dangerous along with people from Facebook groups they have   resorted to threats and harassment of park users  with people   threatening OAP&rsquo;s not very brave of them if they need to pick on OAP   this has been harassment in the internet and physical death threats in   the park . There have been several allegation of the wildlife group   harassing people in the park and these are women who have visited the   park daily for over 6 years feeding the wildlife and now get harassed   by  the group. There is still great concern by swan experts  that they   are taming the swans and treating them like pets not wildlife hand   feeding them with a dog present so they have no fear until one kills   them. Even though people who have many years experience of swans  have   said they may not survive as they are becoming humanised these people   continue to put their lives in danger. All these groups seem to develop a   Hitler complex refusing to listen to anyone and harassing them with new   laws coming out these troll can get a 2 year prison sentance</p>

        <p>Regular   reads will remember in the summer that we had a lot of fish dyeing in   the lake due to lack of oxygen in the water. Of the last couple of week   they have installed aeration devices  and this week on Monday they went   live you need at least 6 to full oxygenate the lake but only 2 have been   installed no doubt cost several thousand pounds to but fit and install   all for the benefit of the fish and fishermen. Above you can see the one   near Tipkinder working a treat.</p>
        <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Tahsmqf6EZc/VCs9K3kY6tI/AAAAAAAAMg0/P4HN5CJV7yc/s1600-h/DSCF8974%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF8974" alt="DSCF8974" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GqzYOwhELjA/VCs9LnXyKyI/AAAAAAAAMg4/2nEDdtLEWN8/DSCF8974_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" width="509" height="382" /></a></p>
        <p>At   the other end of the lake were there is fishing we see one floating and   not turned on WHY? According to reliable information the reason is the   fishermen have complained and dont want it on as it scares the fish.   They didnt think to complain before all the money was spent and they   were installed! Speaking to several fishermen who fish were they use   these they say they are great and the fish love them and it makes for   better fishing. As they only went live on Monday they have not even   given them a chance to see if if they have any effect.</p>
        <p>This is   total madness and waste of public money and who do these fishermen think   they are?   The groups in the park are getting out of hand as they all   think they are Capt Mannering There has been complaints today by lots of   people of harassment by the Wildlife group members who are abusing   people who feed the wildlife they are described as little Hitlers and   all the groups have the same attitude. The Wildlife group are to plant   on the islands but the correct way to do this is to analyse the soil   before you start to test for PH etc before you can choose suitable   plants but the yare not doing any of this and will they know how far   apart to put plants to match growth height etc   </p>

        <p>After   over 5 years and 7 million pounds of renovation parts of the park are   still a tip. Its been that long people wont remember what it used to be   like above is Coronation Walk today un kept and full of weeds and no   water fall. Below is how nice it used to look before they started   renovating it which is better? The park is being destroyed and made   worse than ever</p>

        <p>A   new ram has gone in on the island at the bottom of the lake so the   moorhen's can get on to the island with their young. For  along time   they nest by the little bridge in the bamboo along with rabbits but this   has all been destroyed by the ANTS cleaning it up. Its in borders so   cant go far and it doesnt grow to big but they saw fit to totally   destroy it. in the same area there are 10 self seeded trees that want   pulling out and the borders with bushes are full of weeds but they have   left them. The whole problem is people come into the park think they are   doing good but in fact they are destroying it. They removed very old   plants form the lodge garden that were rare totally wiping them out. The   groups in the park dont have a master plan to work to and just step on   others toes due to lack of communication.  The ANTS put up bird boxes   many in the wrong place facing the wrong way as they dont know what   birds go into which area they dont know what box to put were and put   them facing to wrong way the chicks can get to hot if in direct   sunlight.</p>
        <p>Would you take your car to a garage that let untrained   volunteers repair it no you wouldnt as they could wreck the car in the   same way these people know very little about gardening and wildlife and   just destroy everything. What is needed is groups to work together and   to get trained supervision of these events. In the same way the wildlife   group are feeding the swans in the wrong way and they could suffer as   they are now to use to humans and when they leave they may well suffer   as they seek out humans all of which arnt nice people   </p>

        <p>Two   new power box have gone in this week by the lake ready for the new   aeration scheme to  pump oxygen into the water as the fish were dying   due to lake of oxygen they will float on the surface and be like mini   fountains and have to be anchored down or the spin out of control. This   should have been done as part of the restoration but wasnt done</p>

        <p>A   few Robins are collecting in the park just like Xmas. The cygnet no3   has been returned this week from the RSPCA after it had the fishing line   in its mouth. The swans are now learning to flap their wings and   normally the parents will chase them off but as dad is alone its more   likely they will stay and dad will go and find a new mate return and   then drive them off</p>

              <p>Last   week saw 2 cygnets and a duck caught in fishing line the picture above   show what came from one cygnets mouth and the duck is now in Stapley. So   despite everyone best efforts this is not working. The problem is that   people are going down all day feeding the swans which is good but its   how you feed them that is causing the problems. They are now so tame   they eat out of anyone's hand and this how they are being fed. People   are doing this out of ignorance and think its very good but swans are   wild life not pets. As they are so used to humans they think this is how   they get food so they see fishermen and head over for food and as a   result get caught in line. No Canada gees have been hooked as they are   not hand fed.</p>
              <p>This presents another problem its ok for the duck,   squirrels etc to get very used to humans as they often stay in the park   for life  but swans the father will sooner or later drive them away and   they will leave and find new homes but believing food will come from   humans so they will go to any one and of coarse some people arnt nice   and may catch them for dinner or get hooked in more fishing line. </p>
              <p>The   problem is the hand feeding this must now stop they can be fed from the   bridge or have food placed on the ground for them but humans must back   off so they find food by natural foraging if this doesn't happen they   will leave and be unable to survive in the wild. Problem is people now   wont see that and they will eventually suffer as a result. All wildlife   sanctuaries try to keep human contact to the minimum if creature are to   return to the wild</p>
              <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-7UyTE0eBhXw/VAOqSpoADzI/AAAAAAAAMWo/tFx95gNOBxQ/s1600-h/DSCF8876%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF8876" alt="DSCF8876" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/--KboT-6-5Ok/VAOqTc9pl4I/AAAAAAAAMWs/41b9lkl8cKw/DSCF8876_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="397" width="529" /></a></p>
              <p>above   the power supply for the lake aeration is now in and this will bring   more oxygen to the lake for fish wildlife etc  as fish have been dying   due to lack of oxygen it was part of the original plan along with plants   to help but never got done </p>

        <p>After   last weeks report of the deadly path the Chronicle also ran the story   this week with picture and low and behold a gang of workmen appeared and   created a new feature a mud wrestling ring and closed the path. But at   least its responsible sae now. The council claimed it was down to fly   tipping but as I witness back in may the council do it this wasnt the   case, it sad that you have to get press coverage to get things made safe   when it was so clearly deadly </p>

        <p>Above   is a lethal death trap in the park for  a long time the path at the end   of the lake by the golf coarse has been very bad as its very narrow and   slippery on one side is the lake and the other is a trench left by the   restoration which for ages has been full of dirty stagnant water so   either way you fell you would have got wet. But then the council decided   to create a death trap and dumped a load of rubbish in the trench   turning a wet pool into something lethal. click on the picture and take a   close look at the metal very sharp rusty and just right to kill you. If   you fall onto that your dead or very seriously injured. If that doesn't   get you then there are bricks concrete slabs and other nasty's to crack   your head open. The council have left it like this  and created the   problem them selves. How can anyone say this complies with Health and   Safety laws there can be no argument its deadly and they have done   nothing about it the person who instructed this to be done could be   criminally liable. Even though they know about this nothing has been   done when anyone dies or get hurt they can come on this site for   photographic evidence of the CEC H&amp;S failings and win a compensation   claim</p>

        <p>The   cygnets are doing well with no more fishing problems and are growing   well the only real danger to them now comes from humans and fishing. The   cygnet in Stapley may be able to come back in a couple of weeks lets   hope it doesnt get driven off</p>

        <p>Once   again the fishermen have injured more cygnets one above with a hook in   its mouth and line trailing behind was spotted by the wildlife group <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/</a> and action was taken to save it we hope that its not swallowed the line   and has internal injuries. Once again the low life that do this don't   report it to the RSPCA or anyone to get it help they run off and leave   it to die a horrible painful death. The other cygnet is still at the   RSPCA Stapley and still isn't out of the woods yet lets hope it pulls   through.</p>
        <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-k9i5PMyj7-U/U9WRrFfgk-I/AAAAAAAAMQM/xhlMGe8ac7g/s1600-h/swan%25255B3%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="swan" alt="swan" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Rmo96EoFmok/U9WRrtr9sDI/AAAAAAAAMQQ/SizWOC_ZP-E/swan_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="391" width="521" /></a></p>
        <p>Again   there is a possibility that another has been caught in line tonight and   the one below we are worried about its leg as it seems to be injured.</p>

        <p>The   problem is there is no end in site things are just getting worse with   an almost daily problem and these are not kids fishing these are adults   doing this. Nothing is being done to stop this happening. You can see   below an illegal act not just park rules but its illegal to leave a rod   unattended as it states on the licence <a title="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/rod-limits" href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/rod-limits">https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/rod-limits</a> if found by the environment agency  you can get a hefty fine and banned from fishing <a title="http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm" href="http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm">http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm</a></p>
        <p>Once   kids start in the school hols things will be totally out of control and   the CEC are doing nothing to help the situation they are covering up   criminal acts when swans are attacked every incident with a swan attack   should be reported to the police not covered up.</p>
        <p>Something must   be done I have heard of people suggesting vigilantly patrols and this   must be condemned but people are shocked and upset by lack of response   by the park </p>
        <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-7khHASKj37k/U9WRuAxYY9I/AAAAAAAAMQo/UNhpmk-VgD4/s1600-h/rod%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="rod" alt="rod" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-MNev3lP3unU/U9WRu8___-I/AAAAAAAAMQs/Db-f_fqqsPU/rod_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="448" width="399" /></a></p>
        <p>Going by other park rules in the uk the rules need to be changed</p>
        <p>no ground baiting (the wildlife see this and come over then the angler doesn't lift the rod)</p>
        <p>Clear   notices of how to contact the bailiff so people can report problems and   if they hook wildlife report it. The stupid £5 fee want increasing to a   reasonable £30 then this would pay for more bailiffs</p>
        <p>No catapults these are weapons and not suitable in the park as last week the kids were firing at wildlife.</p>
        <p>Bailiffs   to note who is on what peg and times and that person is responsible for   the peg and to clean up after them ie no left line this would also give   a clue as to who was fishing if wildlife are hurt.</p>
        <p>No casting close to wildlife and rods to be lifted if wildlife come close</p>
        <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Ty4XR3ckbIY/U9WRvsYxqoI/AAAAAAAAMQ8/IzBC6guTRyo/s1600-h/DSCF8960%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF8960" alt="DSCF8960" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ULwacDHA84s/U9WRwetE5aI/AAAAAAAAMRA/95UC8NMu4zA/DSCF8960_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="360" width="540" /></a></p>
        <p>Apart form the cygnets there are a lot of baby ducks moorhens and rabbits to see in the park at this time</p>

              <p>Last   Sat 12th,they  had to use a boat to reach a cygnet that was tangled in   fishing line. On Mon 14th Derek, one of the bailiffs, had to untangle a   cygnet from fishing line. What sort of fisherman hooks up cygnets then   leaves them in horrendous pain to die instead of reporting it to the   RSPCA or the bailiff they can be only described as low life. If you see   anyone doing this report it straight away. Its very clear and proven   beyond a shadow of a doubt that all these problems come from fishing   which is what the wildlife group tried to stop <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensparkwildlife/</a></p>
              <p>Once   the kids come off school things can only get worse and CEC are not   doing anything to solve the problem. Despite the bailiffs and people   turning out to help these things are still happening so they have proved   in effective. So far its only swans that have been the main victims but   the Grebe on the lake this week is also a protect species. Part of the   problem is fishermen using ground bate which the swans see and think its   food then swim over and get caught as the fishermen wont lift their   rods to save them. The bailiffs Tel number needs to be displayed all   around the area so people can report problems. The low fee of £5 is   stupid and should be £35 or so this would provide money for more   bailiffs.      </p>

          <p>got   back from visiting our cygnet at Stapeley. How cool to be allowed to   see him but how sad to hear he has a 50/50 chance of surviving. His   injury, confirmed to be caused by FISHING LINE has made him unable to   walk. If he can not put weight on his leg and is unable to walk he will   have to be put to sleep. Made me want to cry. Poor little thing. He is   on painkillers and my fingers are crossed. More care MUST be taken when   fishing. This is a protected species.</p>
          <p>If there is no action taken   by the fishing group and the park management then more are going to die   the fishermen throw in ground bait and the swans think its food so come   over to them we watched today as swans swam under rods and the   fishermen made no attempt to lift the rod to keep them safe. Once the   kids start then all hell will break loose and the council will do   nothing they remove any comments on Face Book trying to pretend nothing   is happening. If the RSPCA gave the fishing group a £4,000 vets bill   every time this happened they may get their act together.</p>

          <p>Today   volunteers from Queens Park Wildlife Conservation mounted a rescue of   the injured cygnet and many turned up to keep an eye on it while waiting   for the RSPCA. Most of the day members have been on the phone trying to   get help for it. The RSPCA turned up later in the day and helped by   volunteers who are known to the swans it was captured and taken away to   Stapley as it was in to bad of a state to leave. What shocked a lot of   people was that this was all done by volunteers while management who get   paid to do the job by CEC did nothing. Its there job to take action on   injured swans and give a swan in distress caused by fishermen top   priority.</p>

  <p>Call   to ban fishing in the Queens Park after attacks on cygnets. The female   swan died and the body was disposed of so no one could examine it but   the pictures of the dead swan sent to lots of swan rescue centres   believe the injury was from a fishing hook as it&rsquo;s a unique wound and   these are people that rescue swans every day. They cant be 100% as there   is no body but they believe it to be the case. </p>
  <p>Two cygnets were   witnessed being attacked by fishermen purposely trying to hook them one   did hook one. Another witness saw a fisherman hitting the swan with a   landing net, a week ago a cygnet was rescued tangled in fishing line   Sunday saw kids fishing and using a catapult to fire on cygnets and wild   life. Today a cygnet has been caught in line again. Other witness have   seen the attacked with spray cans. Fishermen have been seen kick at   swans My dog was caught in a fishing hook left on the grass as have   other dogs. Fishermen should have to be signed onto a peg then any   problems they can be spoken to as its their responsibility </p>
  <p><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t34.0-12/q73/s720x720/10536463_254804781380098_1753743427_n.jpg?oh=008b83c8c23e379b854b1531fe2903dc&amp;oe=53C654A1&amp;__gda__=1405491946_c6543e5b29465f7e61cc8980017c7ef2" height="400" width="300" /></p>
  <p>The injured cygnet has to wait until tomorrow for the RSPCA to rescue it lets hope its ok</p>
  <p>All   these are actual crimes swans enjoy statutory protection under the   Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally   injure, take or kill a wild swan. As far as we can tell these crimes   have been covered up and not reported to the Police which in its self   may be a crime and CEC may be guilty of this. </p>
  <p>Given this level   of attacks the only sensible action is to ban fishing before we have a   wildlife blood bath despite peoples efforts these crimes are increasing   and measures to stop them are not working. Some swan rescue centres who   have had this sort of problem hold the fishing club responsible and   charge them £4,000 for every rescue and vets bill. All this when we are   supposed to have responsible fishermen once the kids break up and we get   swamped with then all hell will break loose. If action isn&rsquo;t taken then   people may start taking action against these people as the CEC sit back   and do nothing again. </p>
  <p>The new wildlife group have people   looking after the swans as best they can and you can join in and help   save the swans on facebook <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/</a></p>
  <p>Anyone   seeing attacks on swans should call the Police as its a criminal   offence lets get the Police down and prosecute these people it will   deter others from doing it </p>

  <p>This   may help to some degree with problems but only if people take action on   what is seen. Below the fence broken by kids going fishing, they had   fun playing with the boats last week and were on the boat hut</p>

        <p>The   first meeting of the new group took place today in the park soured by a   heavy downpour of rain but still over 20 people turned up for the   meeting. It was set up after the mysterious death of the female who had 7   cygnets one of which has gone missing. The aim of the group is to   protect the wildlife in the park mostly from humans after there have   been now 5 witness attacks of the cygnets none of which have been   reported to the Police as they have been as its a criminal offence.</p>
        <p>On   objective is to make the islands a safe haven by providing suitable   plants on them and building some sort of steps so wildlife can get to   safety on the island. A few companies have shown interest it helping   including Bentley, PET Hire and Cheshire work wear. The next meeting   will be next Sunday at 2pm in the bowling hut. You can join the group on   facebook <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1502881536594395/</a></p>

        <p>One   of the problem faced by wildlife is as you can see a very large dog off   the lead there are many dogs off lead and they often attack wildlife   despite there being a bylaw on the park that they must be on the lead</p>

              <p>After the horrific <a href="http://www.queensparkcrewe.com/2014/06/dead-swan.html">Death of the mother swan</a> who had 7 signets in the Queens Park which is still a mystery more   attacks have happened this week. We heard disturbing news off a bailiff   fisherman. He has witnessed <strong>twice in one day</strong>, two males   fishing who purposely dangled bait in front of the cygnets and caught   them up. The bailiff had to untangle them and threaten the males   involved. Another witness told me how he had seen a fisherman hitting a   swan with a keep net so that is a total of 3 attacks in one day. The   mothers death is still a mystery as its claimed by the press that the   RSPCA have no knowledge of it but it was quoted on Face Book that the   park had called them and it was the wardens who had made the call but   speaking to them this week they said they hadn't made a call and knew   nothing about the dead swan. The body has disappeared and a request to   the park were it went hasnt been answered. A vet who specialises in   swans looked at our photo and said with out the body he cant be sure but   it looked like a human attack from the photo as there were no canine   teeth marks. </p>
              <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-kyVv4qlCZU0/U632p1_XqyI/AAAAAAAAMDk/tfqvAR9_oDQ/s1600-h/DSCF8769%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img title="DSCF8769" alt="DSCF8769" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-0GoEBWSU_ao/U632qcIfXgI/AAAAAAAAMDo/-t1gzJxu1Ss/DSCF8769_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="360" width="540" /></a></p>
              <h5>Legal status</h5>
              <p>As   native wild birds, swans enjoy statutory protection under the Wildlife   and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally injure,   take or kill a wild swan.  </p>
              <p>The Act similarly protects the eggs   and nests of swans. It is an offence to take or possess the egg of a   wild mute swan, or to damage or destroy the nest of a mute swan whilst   in use or being built. Unfortunately, swans and their nests are   sometimes a target for vandals.  </p>
              <p>Anyone seeing an offence against   swans or other wildlife is encouraged to contact their police Wildlife   Liaison Officer through their local police station. </p>
              <p>There is   history at the Queens Park of swan abuse with vandals stealing and   smashing their eggs and no one does anything about it but now a new   wildlife conservation group has been formed and the first meeting will   be in the Queens Park pavilion Sun 6th July if you want to help save the   wildlife in the park come along. You may wish to ask your local   councillor why the CEC isnt doing anything to protect the wildlife as   they have a duty of care. Since the attacks they have taken no action to   patrol the park or get the Police in to investigate. </p>

              <p>There   are other problems in the park this week kids covered the CCTV on the   bowling hut and then rode bikes all over the green. Above the Gulf War   memorial that was regenerated by the ANTS now has all the new plants   dying do to the fact that they plants have been left and have not been   watered in hot weather. Its no good putting these things in then just   leaving them to rot they need care in the early stages. </p>
              <p>Further dead fish have been seen in the lake</p>
              <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-0S5hem5BVTc/U64NScy68rI/AAAAAAAAMEM/hXOGxRX8Oa0/s1600-h/DSCF8589%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF8589" alt="DSCF8589" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-1Swxu_AMyzM/U64NTLLWxyI/AAAAAAAAMEQ/3iKae0V6KMs/DSCF8589_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="392" width="522" /></a> </p>
              <p><strong>People in Danger in the Queens Park?</strong></p>
              <p>Lots   of complaints about the main path by the lake which is thick with   smelly goose dropping which can be toxic to children and dogs. The CEC   has failed in its duty of care leaving this in such a state</p>
              <p>Canada   geese feces can be hazardous to people's health, but usually only when   inhaled or ingested. Walking past geese feces, or even lounging near   them on the beach is likely safe for healthy people. However, the   elderly, children, and pregnant or breastfeeding women are particularly   susceptible to health risks posed by parasites that inhabit Canada geese   feces. At even higher risk are those with weak immune systems, such as   people with HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy recipients, and recent organ donors   and recipients. Similarly, people with gastrointestinal (GI) problems,   such as ulcers and irritable bowel disease, are also at increased risk,   since they, too, cannot easily combat parasites from Canada geese feces. </p>
              <p>Geese feces usually contain the parasites <em>cryptosporidium, giardia, coliform,</em> and <em>campylobacter</em>. <em>Cryptosporidium</em> poses the most serious health hazard, since it causes cryptosporidiosis, an illness with the following symptoms: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>watery diarrhea </li>
                <li>dehydration </li>
                <li>weight loss </li>
                <li>stomach cramps or pain </li>
                <li>fever </li>
                <li>nausea </li>
                <li>vomiting </li>

        <p>There are still 6 signets left and we have lots of people watching out for them after the mysterious death of the mother. <strong>The   controversy roles on with claims made by the press that the RSPCA no   nothing about the death  even though the park made this statement on    Face book</strong>  Sadly Swan found dead on the lake this morning.   RSCPA notified. All indications are eaten, possibly by a fox, no   indication of being ravished by dog. Hence previous assumption removed   off the web as unnecessary. However, mum may possibly find it difficult   to look after all her young, so please all keep monitoring them and   help. She has plenty of food thank you to all.

        <p><strong>Queens Park wildlife conservation group</strong></p>
        <p>The group was setup after the death of a swan and other wildlife the aims and objectives are. </p>
        <p>Urgent need for ramps onto all islands on the lake so wildlife can escape onto them away from human and natural predators </p>
        <p>Islands to be planted with wildlife friendly plants to provide cover and suitable nesting </p>
        <p>Lake   plants need to be planted to provide to oxygenate the water and provide   nesting for wildlife reed beds are needed in the middle of the lake for   protected species that cant nest on land ie Grebe </p>
        <p>Make the park   more wildlife friendly by planting suitable bushes and plants to   encourage wild life which fits in with the schools education programme </p>
        <p>After   a serious dog attack last year we were promised a dog control order   which hasn&rsquo;t been actioned dogs off the lead are a major problem as they   attack wildlife and children the order is of no use unless dog wardens   enforce it. The remaining swan was attacked last week by a dog off the   lead. </p>
        <p>Small water holes to be placed around park for wildlife to drink from as most can drink from the lake. </p>
        <p>Log piles and bee hotel to get more insects in the park cost nothing and helpful for children&rsquo;s education. </p>
        <p>There will be a meeting in the park pavilion on Sunday 6th July 2pm all invited </p>
        <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-481YJpGGO-E/U6oP2raUU1I/AAAAAAAAMC8/ufebIxkqUEY/s1600-h/DSCF8570%25255B4%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSCF8570" alt="DSCF8570" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-z7Tpb_T7umY/U6oP3KqxtsI/AAAAAAAAMDA/cc8nzwSfjMI/DSCF8570_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="301" width="508" /></a></p>
        <p>There   has been a lot of dead fish in the lake estimates between 50-100 and   experts say this is down to failure of the CEC not providing plants for   the lake or a fountain to oxygenate the lake. Its believed they all died   due to lake of oxygen. This is all despite Cllr Jones promising last   year to do all he could to protect the wildlife in the park they have   failed to get the dog control order requested last year and no effort   has been made to do anything for wildlife  </p>

              <p>After   the death of the swan last week this week a signet has gone missing and   its reported today that there are 100 dead fish in the lake. A member   of swan watch witnessed a staffy type dog attack the remaining swan   while it was off the lead. What is going on when will someone do   something?</p>
              <p>The Wagtails are about on the lake catching flies for   their young and there is also baby moorhens on the lake they are very   tiny and vulnerable</p>

              <p>More   illegal fishing below these came with big dogs and fished at the wrong   end of the lake with bread which the ducks were trying to eat as it was   floating make you wonder about these and the dogs?</p>

              <p>This   is an upsetting image of the dead swan but it is evidence of what has   happened. It is claimed on Facbook that it was found on the lake   headless and a carcass on Tuesday am. But this photo was taken at 7:45   on Monday by 5 witness to its death. Its claimed its a fox. But the   facts are its very rare for a fox to come out in the day when people are   about and this happened in broad day light between 4-7 o'clock.      Foxes and swans have lived in the park for years and its never happened   before. Why would a fox take on a swan when there is easy picking with   other wildlife special lots of rabbits which would not put up a fight?</p>
              <p>Foxes   normally only kill for food and take the head straight away as its the   most nourishing part. If it was a fox in daylight doing this are   children safe? We know this was in the bushes the swans have never ever   gone in the bushes.</p>
              <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-4XP1GXkcd5U/U5pCO3g1GRI/AAAAAAAAL9I/iuSA_5UGQAI/s1600-h/bitemark76%25255B2%25255D.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="bitemark76" alt="bitemark76" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-F3JShggC48o/U5pCPUvNIRI/AAAAAAAAL9M/YyHaFRIRedk/bitemark76_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" height="303" width="360" /></a></p>
              <p>But   look at the swan it has a single hole in  the neck a bite from a fox or   a dog would look like the above with the two canine teeth 25mm apart   and a dog similar but wider so if there isnt the two bite marks it   suggest it wasnt done by a dog or fox everyone who has seen the picture   agrees with this. So what has killed it? As the body has disappeared we   may never know and cant find out but a single hole suggests a shot or a   arrow or something like that we will never know. If anyone saw the swans   on monday let us know we know it was ok up till 4 oclock so if you saw   it after then alive we can narrow down the time if you saw anything else   or heard anything let us know. We have sent the images to experts to   see if they can provide any more evidence as to what did this</p>

              <p>The   two swans have had 7 signets in the Queens Park a few weeks ago. Last   year they had four signets the first time in 10 years but they all   disappeared in mysterious circumstances. This year members of the   wildlife group from the park setup Swan watch so members would come in   during opening times to keep an eye on the swans. Last night 5 June at   7:15 they found mother the swan dead in the bushes it had not been eaten   which suggests it was a fox that did this as that would have only   killed for food. We believe its the results of a dog attack as dogs off   the lead have been a problem for along time. Witness saw a greyhound   type dog attack the signets a few weeks ago until a member shouted at   the owner.</p>

              <p>A   photo taken today of a dog off the lead heading towards the swans at   1:30. On Sunday a dog off the lead caused havoc around the children's   play area for over an  hour. The park and the dog wardens refuse to do   their jobs and protect both children and wildlife.</p>
              <p>The Park has   tried to cover up this story and are lying about the incident below you   can see on QP facebook they claim it was dead in the water and reported   to the RSPCA when it was reported the night before by our members why   are they lying and trying to cover up what has happen?</p>

              <p>Sadly   Swan found dead on the lake this morning. RSCPA notified. All   indications are eaten, possibly by a fox, no indication of being   ravished by dog. Hence previous assumption removed off the web as   unnecessary. However, mum may possibly find it difficult to look after   all her young, so please all keep monitoring them and help. She has   plenty of food thank you to all. Thank you Waynne also for your prompt   call. </p>
              <p>Problems in the past are highlighted by this incident the   same German Shepard was in the park off the lead on the day in   questions.</p>

              <p>Monday   @ 2 oclock I was standing by the Gulf War memorial in the park talking   to a lady with a Yorkshire terrier and another man watch by the   gardeners. A larges German Sheppard came towards of the lead both are   dogs were on leads. I explained to the owner dogs must be on the lead in   the park. The next minute his dog savagely attacked the lady ran for   her life fearing for her dogs safety. Fortunately my puppy is an Alaskan   Malumute and was able to defend his self while the man made vain   attempts to stop his dog. He eventual got hold of his dog but became   abusive and still refused to put it on a lead despite being shouted at   by the gardeners and walked off shouting abuse with it still off the   lead there were 9 witness to the attack. </p>
              <p>We went straight to the   dog wardens office and explained what had happened and told them he was   still in the park so they could catch him. In front of 4 witness they   state. </p>
              <p>Its not an offence for a dog to attacks a dog and wouldn&rsquo;t do anything or call the Police. </p>
              <p>The don&rsquo;t patrol the park </p>
              <p>The cant enforce not having a dog on the lead in the park even though its stated as a bylaw. </p>
              <p>Its not the councils job to deal with this sort of problem. </p>
              <p>We pointed to another dog running loose and they did nothing for 15 mins then drove round the dog was a 3 min walk away. </p>
              <p>We   want the dog wardens to undergo further training so they can do their   job properly a quick look at the official Government site <a href="https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/overview">https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/overview</a></p>
              <p>Shows it is a crime to have a dangerous dog loose, the council can enforce it and it is their responsibility. The site <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/controlling-your-dog-in-public">http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/controlling-your-dog-in-public</a></p>
              <p>States Dogs which behave dangerously may be seized by the <strong>dog warden</strong>, and their owners prosecuted. The dogs may be destroyed if the magistrate considers that they are a danger to the public. </p>
              <p>This   man is a regular in the park and never has his dog on the lead he   normally goes by the bandstand between 12:30 and 2 oclock as do many   others off the lead. The posh man and women visit at these times of the   day with a black Labrador off the lead and they claim the law doesn&rsquo;t   apply to them. As the children are off school still and the park is now   used for young children for education purposes its vital the dog wardens   get out of their offices and catch these people. If a child had been   near when it attacked it could have easily been killed by such a big   dog. Its noted by many users that a certain councillor visit the park   every day and sets a bad example with her dog off the lead. </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Overview From Government website</strong></p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control: </p>
              <p>in a public place </p>
              <p>in a private place where the dog isn&rsquo;t allowed to be (eg a neighbour&rsquo;s house or garden without permission) </p>
              <p>The law applies to <strong>all</strong> dogs. </p>
              <p>Some <a href="https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/banned-dogs">types of dogs are banned</a>. </p>
              <p><strong>Out of control</strong></p>
              <p>Your dog is considered dangerously out of control if it: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>injures someone </li>
                <li>makes someone worried that it might injure them</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A court could also decide that your dog is dangerously out of control if: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>it injures someone&rsquo;s animal </li>
                <li>the owner of the animal thinks they could be injured if they tried to stop your dog attacking their animal</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A farmer is allowed to kill your dog if it&rsquo;s worrying their livestock. </p>
              <p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
              <p>You   can be fined up to £5,000 and/or sent to prison for up to 6 months if   your dog is out of control. You may also not be allowed to own a dog in   the future. </p>
              <p>If you let your dog injure someone, you can be sent to prison for up to 2 years and/or fined. </p>
              <p>If   you deliberately use your dog to injure someone you could be charged   with &lsquo;malicious wounding&rsquo;. The maximum penalty is 5 years in prison. </p>
              <p><strong>Dog Control Orders</strong></p>
              <p>Local councils in England and Wales can issue Dog Control Orders (DCOs). </p>
              <p>These mean that in public areas with DCOs, you may have to: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>keep your dog on a lead </li>
                <li>put your dog on a lead if told to by a police officer, police community support officer or someone from the council </li>
                <li>stop your dog going in certain places - like farmland or parts of a park </li>
                <li>limit the number of dogs you have with you (this applies to professional dog walkers too) </li>
                <li>clear up after your dog</li>
              </ul>
              <p>DCOs <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> apply to private land if you have permission from the land owner or person who controls the land. </p>
              <p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
              <p>If you ignore a DCO, you can be fined: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>£50 on the spot (a &lsquo;Fixed Penalty Notice&rsquo;) </li>
                <li>up to £1,000 if it goes to court</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> be fined if you&rsquo;re a registered blind dog owner. </p>
              <p><strong>DCOs in your area</strong></p>
              <p>Local councils must let the public know where DCOs are in place. </p>
              <p><strong>Example</strong> If dogs aren&rsquo;t allowed in a park, there must be signs saying so. </p>
              <p>If   the council plans to put a new DCO in place, it must put up a notice   and publish it in a local newspaper and on its website. </p>
              <p>The notice must tell you: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>where the new DCO will apply </li>
                <li>if there&rsquo;s a map and where you can see it </li>
                <li>where you can write or email to have your say - you should have at least 28 days </li>
              </ul>
              <p>After   28 days, your local council will decide whether to go ahead with the   DCO or change it. If there are lots of changes, the council will publish   another notice, with the same timescales. </p>
              <h5>Report a dog</h5>
              <p>Anyone can report a dog and their owner to the police. </p>
              <p>You can report a dangerous dog to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council">your council&rsquo;s</a> dog warden service. </p>
              <p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-dog-fouling">report dog fouling</a> to your local council. </p>

        <p>The   swans are doing well and the parents have learnt from last year and   sticking closer to the babies this time. Above they are wandering around   the park like troops on parade with mum in front and dad taking up the   rear. They have spent a lot of time on the main drive and other grass</p>

        <p>The   bowling hut has had small plaques put on the drains to remember Frank   Web and Richardmoon we are taking bets how long they will last. The   ducting for CCTV has started going in so maybe that will deter the   vandals. </p>

        <p>The   main balcony at the cafe is going to have to be replaced just a couple   of years after it was built as the underlings structure isn't sound and   will have to be replaced </p>

        <p>members   of the parks wildlife group are keeping a close eye on the swans and   babies. A witness saw a man on a bike with  a grey hound type of dog off   the lead attack the signets this week luckily they were close to mum   and water and escaped but the dog followed them into the water. Being in   the water the swan was able to defend her young. Last year the baby   swans disappeared in mysterious circumstances  so we are trying to keep   watch over them this year. If anyone sees any thing happening to a swan   call the Police straight away</p>

              <p><strong>Danger</strong></p>
              <p>At   the end of the lake were there is a mini lake the council have chucked   rubbish in it for what purpose I dont know as its just dumped there and   just make it worse not better. What is a muddy hole full of water has   now been turned into a death trap. You can see there is rusty metal that   is razor sharp so fall on that or catch it with your leg and it could   cut you in half, add to that the concrete and its a lot more dangerous   than if they had left it alone</p>

              <p>The   babies are sticking close together in the water lets hope this year   they survive as last year they got a few months old and after being   hooked by fishermen the last 3 disappeared in mysterious circumstances.   As a swan and eggs have been removed from a local site we need to keep   our eye out for anyone messing with them. </p>

        <p>The   Mayor Cllr Dorothy Flude  came for a ride on the boats in the park this   week. We are having major problems with the boats not being supervised.   The first incident were people using the boats to run over baby ducks   and chase them around the lake while staff did nothing. There were then   two separate incidents reported by the fishing bailiff and seen by   others. These are serious problems that rowers got near the far side of   the island and messed with eggs on a gooses nest. On the second occasion   they threw the eggs and smashed them. If it had been the swans eggs   they could face prosecution. Again on all these occasions staff did   nothing they must supervise these boats and walk round to see none of   this type of behaviour happens. They are making lots of money from the   boats so they must protect wildlife and stop vandalism.   </p>

        <p>Its   a major wildlife week this week with 7 baby swans being born. Last year   was the first year we had young but none survived so this year is a   bumper year. There are baby ducks one has 12 babies another with 5 and   one with 4 but these tend to loose a lot to gulls and dogs. There have   been idiots with a black dog letting it chase duck on Sunday.</p>

              <p>The   first baby ducks appeared this week with the mother of 5 chicks   swimming around. How long will they last as people watched on Sunday as   kids in a boat chased them all over the lake trying to run the chicks   over and the staff never saw anything. The boat have duel hulls so they   can run   them over and kill them with the paddle blades</p>

              <p>Once again fishing gives problems spot the <a href="http://www.fisheries.co.uk/news/news/marshall.htm" target="_blank">illegal activity</a> above. This is often happening and <a href="http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Angry-angler-fined-leaving-rods-unattended/story-19646524-detail/story.html" target="_blank">highly illegal</a> leaving a rod unattended and often its happens while the fisherman goes   to relive himself in the bushes which is also illegal. The offence is   worse in the park   as should a swan or wildlife be caught in an   unattended line it could drag it all around the lake and suffer a lot of   pain and suffering. It now closed season but that didnt stop 7 fishing   anyway. Its up for review at the next friends meeting and so far there   hasnt been a lot of fishing due to the weather etc so given all the   problems once kids are off school they arnt going to cope</p>

              <p>The   boat are back on the lake and are very expensive costing up to £10   which is a lot just to row around a little island as they shouldn&rsquo;t row   down the bottom of the lake because of fishing. Some have gone down the   bottom so they wont be very popular. Even after a couple of days   problems are starting to come to light. The boats are being tied up on   the island at night were the swan is nesting and as such if she leaves   the nest she can only get back on at one spot and that is were they are   putting the boats so she could loose the eggs as she cant get back. Also   people are going close the the island were she is nesting which isn&rsquo;t   helping. Its frightening the ducks away and they are going down the   bottom of the lake were they are fishing as such risk being hooked by   fishermen. </p>
              <p>One important concern is who are the people running   the boats as they help young children in and out of the boat questions   have been asked are these people CRB checked are they first aiders and   are they life guards in case someone falls in? </p>

              <p>Ants </p>
              <p>There   has been a lot of discussion about ANTS this week on social media etc   as a result of a letter to the Chronicle complaining. ANTS was formed   when the BBC highlighted the state of the park and Cllr Jones asked for   backing from local people. He specifically stated that he didn&rsquo;t expect   people to pick up rubbish etc that&rsquo;s was the councils role. </p>
              <p>The   ANTS was then formed and they held a meeting in the park it was clear   from the start that they weren&rsquo;t going to listen to what users had to   say they had their own ideas and that was that. Most of the founders by   their own admission hadn&rsquo;t been to the park in 2 years so new nothing   about it or what was going on or what people who visit daily felt about   the park and they weren&rsquo;t going to<strong> listen</strong>. </p>
              <p>They   started doing some bench repairs and brushing up some of the rubbish   from the first day last August is still piled up near the café and now a   lovely garden of nettles. </p>
              <p>Many people then commented that one   leader ran her own hairdressing company and as such was using ANTS to   promote her company, another had political aspirations and was using it   to further his political career. There were then problem with allegation   of ANTS leaders coming in the park slagging off Friends and other   people and verbally and emotionally abusing people. You don&rsquo;t have to   agree with what people say but defend their right to express their   opinion the ANTS seem to take a Gestapo approach if you don&rsquo;t agree with   hem then you are trash an example is these comments about the writer of   the letter to the paper given they know nothing about this person </p>
              <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chris.curran.142?fref=ufi">Chris Curran</a> I've now read the letter . I think the old duffer has neglected to take   his medication writing some intolerable nonsense as that </p>
              <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/matthew.reen?fref=ufi">Matthew Reen</a> Pfffttt, I hope he has a bad Friday and the easter bunny doesn't visit him, loser! </p>
              <p>This   trend seems to have become the norm if you don&rsquo;t agree with what they   say then they become abusive on social media and threaten people who   cant defend them selves. They have continued brushing up and cutting   down shrubs etc in doing this they have destroyed the nesting areas that   were used by wildlife so they have no were left to breed, damaged the   heated floor in the bowling hut with varnish. </p>
              <p>The council was   applying to the lottery for a further 1.2 million pounds to do the paths   it was then found out the cost was on £320,000 so the CEC decided they   would pay for the path and as a result the lottery who were holding back   £500,00 released the money giving the CEC a profit on the deal. The   ANTS claim it was all there doing which it wasn&rsquo;t. </p>
              <p>The argument   is now that by cleaning up they are just doing someone out of a job and   the results only last for a day or so before its back to the state again   as there are no full time people cleaning up. The only long term things   they have done is the bench&rsquo;s and planted the gulf war memorial area.   The latter has had plants stolen and half the other are dying as you   cant just put plants in when its very dry weather not water them and   expect them to live. </p>

              <p>The   grebe was back  again this week but was down the bottom of the lake and   at risk from fishing as they dive and swim great distances under water   were they can be caught in the line. They are a protected species and   heavy fines if they are hurt</p>

        <p>They   have made it nice and simply for yobs to break into the park at night   and cause trouble. Down by the golf coarse the fence has been removed   for repair and temp fence put up which the kids have wrecked and left in   a dangerous position and left it wide open to get in the park at night.</p>

        <p>With   the swan on the nest the other swan has become a killer spending most   of the day attacking Canada geese all around the park. We watched as he   jumped on the back of one and pushed it under the water and it never   came back up. This isnt the first time they have done this they killed   one of the white geese before.</p>

                <p>New   plants were planted just over a week ago at the Gulf War memorial and   by the Bowling hut but today some have been stolen and other pulled out   at both locations some of them were Pieris and no doubt now in someone's   garden or given as a present. The memorial has just returned after   being vandalized and has been put back at the same location. In my view   if its been broken once it will happen again and should be moved to a   more public location so its harder for the yobs. There have been large   stones found in the area as if they have been used to attack it. In the   photo you can see the holes which once contained plants that ANTS   planted. Ants have still not replied about the scouts who offered them   help maybe they now dont want anyone else to join the group and help</p>

              <p>The   swan is still nesting on the island but after we bought hay to help her   build a nest the park manager refused to get it put on the island so   she has no material to make a decant nest which will have an impact as   eggs will be colder without straw to keep them warm. There are no   materials for any wildlife to build nest and much of the cover they used   to hide has been destroyed by the ANTS last year</p>

                          <p>The friends meeting was held last week and the <a href="http://www.crewetown.co.uk/friends.htm" target="_blank">mins are here</a> The interesting bits are they now have money to pay to restore thing   that have been restored. They are also contemplating a web site which   would evolve spending money raised for the park on it instead of   providing nesting for wildlife or other useful things. Considering my   two sites  have been running for over 5 years with 1,000 of photo and   weekly reports wit hover a million hits whats the point of wasting money   on another one? I had an offer from the scouts to help the ANTS and I   passed this on to them over a week ago and they have not responded so I   assume they dont want help?</p>

                          <p>With   the few nice days we have had spring has burst into life the rabbits   are out down Coronation walk. The swans are trying to nest on the island   but have nothing to make a nest from. The wildlife group brought hay   but no one would put it on the island for us</p>

                <p>This   week the Guld war memorial has returned after it had been vandalised   and its better than ever.

        <p>More   signs of spring as lots of robins about the trees being blown over have   brought more birds to the park as the wood contains insects etc and the   birds have moved in to cleanup.</p>

        <p>The Queens Park ANTs (Actions Not Talk) volunteers met last weekend to continue the winter clear-up and greet new members. </p>
        <p>The   event was billed as a &ldquo;Drop-In&rdquo; session where potential new volunteers   could see what goes on and ask questions about the on-going projects   around the park, and numbers were boosted by members of the Sydney Arms   Slimming World Group. </p>
        <p>Sheila Cotton, SW group leader, said:   &lsquo;Getting involved with the ANTs was perfect as part of our Body Magic   programme. Members are encouraged to be more active at home and in the   community, so helping out at Queens Park was great exercise and everyone   benefits.&rsquo; </p>
        <p>The ANTs are an informal group that meet monthly and   new volunteers are welcome to spend just an hour, or as long as they   can spare. The work is light and easy-going, but a great fun way to burn   off a few post-Christmas pounds. Gloves, hi-vis jackets and basic tools   are supplied. </p>
        <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:queensparkants@hotmail.com">queensparkants@hotmail.com</a> for further details about the next session. </p>

              <h5>The   wigeon above  is a medium-sized duck with a round head and small bill.   The head and neck of the male are chestnut, with a yellow forehead, pink   breast and grey body. In flight birds show white bellies and males have   a large white wing patch. Birds breed in central and northern Scotland   and also in northern England. Many birds visit the UK in winter from   Iceland, Scandinavia and Russia. With large numbers of wintering birds   at a few UK sites it is an Amber List species.</h5>

              <p>By   Tipkinder end the one tree was badly hit butt other in the area lost   lots of branches each tree that falls means other trees are in danger of   wind damage. a very large tree came down by the golf coarse end of the   lake</p>

        <p><strong>5 Chairman&rsquo;s Report and Update</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Derek Morgan </strong>welcomed all attendees. </p>
        <p><strong>5.1 Works in progress</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Small works packages are underway:</strong></p>
        <p>Designs   and specification for mini-tender purposes are shortly to go to   specialist Heritage Contractors via Assets. The works are for: </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>West Lodge:</strong> possible renewal of a section of the main horizontal load-bearing   timber beam to the rear elevation. Carving of bespoke wordage on the new   beam is required and may need to be carried out off-site and then   installed once prepared. </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Main Entrance:</strong> Rails and gate are to be repaired. Ornate features to be recreated where needed as broken. Curbed rails are to be repaired </p>
        <p><strong>Entrance areas East, West, South Gates</strong>:   Crest plaques are to be installed. The base plates are already on the   gates in readiness. (A copy of the design was available for attendees to   view). </p>
        <p><strong>Bowls Pavilion</strong> : Installation of rainwater goods to Front Elevation –  this is required for Building Regulation Approval </p>
        <p><strong>Gulf War memorial – </strong>the<strong> </strong>base went in last week. The monument is now back or return is imminent. </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Electrical works</strong> in Lakeside Pavilion, East and West Lodges for building regulations –   works are mainly to the toilet (disabled provision) and kitchen venting.<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Planning and possibly listed building consent</strong> will be required for the package of works Assets are also currently collating a package for: </p>
        <p><strong>Boer War Memorial</strong></p>
        <p>Work   to clean off kerbs, and posts, 24 new post fixings, re-fix, supply and   install new chains and eyelets, inner plinths to be cleaned </p>
        <p><strong>Clock Tower</strong></p>
        <p>Damaged sandstone ball to be replaced </p>
        <p>Plaque to be cleaned and wording picked-out. </p>
        <p><strong>Games pavilion</strong></p>
        <p>Engineer   to inspect structure due to movement in wooded frame and cladding. Same   engineer to report on Lakeside Pavilion veranda re non-slip strips. </p>
        <p>For all of the above we are anticipating at least £29K worth of investment. </p>
        <hr />
        <h4 align="justify"><strong>It   would seem we are now paying to restore the restoration? How on earth   can we pay for thing like the cafe and pavilion to be brought up to   building regulation standard when they are new how did all these things   get passed and paid for if they arnt right? If you buy a kettle you get a   2 year guarantee so you would expect a longer one for over 1.5 million   pound cafe. </strong>Many of the items above only require a handy   man to fix them but in will go to tender and with admin cost £1000 which   could be done for  a £10 from B&amp;Q        </h4>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>5.3 Footpaths</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Design Issues</strong></p>
        <p>This   phase of works needs to comply with the original HLF funded submission.   Design brief/standard details will need to have approval and are   currently underway, this will encompass - </p>
        <p>1. DDA compliance, or as close as practical, to be achieved to all areas of the park. </p>
        <p>2. Restoration of path network around the north of the park. </p>
        <p>3. Restoration of southern paths (to the rear of the lake) </p>
        <p>4. Support vehicular access improvements around park </p>
        <p>5. Undertake hard and soft general landscape works required in relation to path works </p>
        <p>· Identify / cost the surface finish options </p>
        <p>· Provide a consistent edge detail to pathways. </p>
        <p>· Complete granite edge to main primary route. </p>
        <p>- Include sections of concrete kerb repair/infill. </p>
        <p>- Include sections of limestone kerb repair/infill. </p>
        <p>- Remove crazy paving only on paths to be restored. </p>
        <p>- (Coronation Valley route not included in works) </p>
        <p>· Additionally DDA ramp to one bandstand (Southern Shelter) is requested. </p>
        <p>· Any drainage issues to be identified. </p>
        <p>· Stabilisation of bank to south west boundary. Allow for use of large sandstone rocks &amp; soil infill. </p>
        <p>· Additional bays for seating to be included where appropriate. </p>
        <p>·   In some areas roots may be a problem, consultation with tree officer is   required. Some invasive seedling ash/sycamore/bamboo could be removed   as part of the path restoration. </p>
        <p>· Approvals for funding have   passed the first stage and we are hopeful of full Council approval with   an early start to works this Spring. </p>
        <p><strong>5.4 CCTV</strong></p>
        <p>Elaine   Dodd has liaised with English Heritage and CEC Conservation Officer,   who both have posed no objection to the columns and their locations. She   has completed a Planning application which was despatched a fortnight   ago with advice received from the CCTV Controller&rsquo;s team. Approval time   is anticipated 12-15 weeks. In the meantime preparation works can   continue re BT licences, ducting and cabling works, external equipment   housing. The purchase of equipment is around £25K in total for 2 fully   functional black 'predator' cameras (360 Vision Technology) that will   pan 360 degrees and tilt of 180 degrees. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>CCTV is no good if there is no one to enforce it</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>5.5 Lakeside Pavilion</strong></p>
        <p>Elaine is working closely with the <em>Pickle Jar</em> to assist in marketing the facilities. Ideas to date include: </p>
        <p>A <strong>Wedding Information Pack</strong> – She has prepared some draft designs to keep costs down for them, including the idea of Inserts make the pack flexible. </p>
        <p>Plus an idea, to introduce a <strong>PRINCE and PRINCESSES Club</strong>.   A modest membership fee would apply; when joining, each child would   receive a membership card and gift. Prior to their birthday each year,   they would receive notification about children&rsquo;s parties in the   pavilion, encouraging parents to have &ldquo;the mess here and not at home&rdquo;,   then a birthday card with offer of a free ice cream or similar. It is   envisaged that the child would bring along friends and guardians so the   scheme would also generate some purchases . Collection of addresses and   emails is an issue as someone needs to keep on top of applications and   dispatch information. Resultant data could also be utilised on a   database for other forms of &lsquo;relationship marketing&rsquo;. </p>
        <p><strong>5.6 Boating on the Lake</strong> – plans are underway to re-introduce this. A contractor has looked at   the area and is developing plans for a landing stage, together with   tidying of perimeter. Works to fencing, steps etc will be separate. The   Pickle Jar&rsquo;s bank are ascertaining details about how other areas operate   and this will assist with Risk Assessments and Insurance issues. </p>

        <h4>The   boats were on the lake this week as a trial apparently they can only go   as far as the bridge so they dont disturb the fishermen we wouldn't   want to do that would we. How many people will pay just to paddle around   one island is open to debate. What is clear is there is conflict with   wildlife straight away as most of the ducks etc stay at the top end and   nest will be disturbed and wildlife frightened by these boats. Its show   the CEC have no respect for any wildlife</h4>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>5.7 Memorial Benches</strong></p>
        <p>Three   new benches have been purchased by families, including one for Lindsay   Capper one of the Park Wardens who sadly passed away. Elaine Dodd is to   escort Lindsay&rsquo;s mother to view the bench located next to the bowling   green. Hopefully, her photograph and a press story will create more   enquires. A summary information sheet is available and the Cemetery are   kindly adding this insert into their bereavement packs. </p>
        <p>5.8 There is some external funding support from Highways for <strong>Cycle Racks</strong> to complement the adjacent cycleway. Some improvement works to the   entry to the cycleway at TipKinder is also planned of installation in   March. </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>5.9 Burma Star Island</strong></p>
        <p>A   sponsorship package has been sent out to &lsquo;The Round Table&rsquo; for their   kind consideration, following a meeting last year with the ANTs and   Elaine . The Round Table held a meeting last week so we await their   support concerning this project with interest. The Friends have already   committed funding raising toward this project and residual monies will   have to be made up from either existing Ground Maintence Budgets or a   grant application to WREN, or a mixture of the two. Plans are also be   revisited and updated and will be presented at the next meeting. </p>
        <p>It   was stressed that the Friends have not specified an exact amount to be   used from their funds but will commit an agreed sum as previously voted   to support this scheme. An estimated project figure of £12-15K has been   calculated, this is to be discussed at a future meeting. </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>5.10 The CEC Queens Park Website</strong> Elaine Dodd has recently been updated re Works in Progress, Benches, Angling and Events Calendar. </p>
        <p><strong>Friends of Queens Park Website</strong>:   Sheila Blackburn (Secretary) has suggested that the group has its own   web site. Secretary is to write to a web-site designer, known to CEC, to   invite him to discuss issues at the next Friends meeting in March.   Kristy Taylor, ANT&rsquo;s, is also very knowledge in this regard and   specialises at work in IT so is able to assist. </p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>6 Events Diary to date</strong></p>
        <p>Last   year we probably saw more community type events here than in the   previous 20 years. The draft programme to-date is available and is to be   posted on notice boards in the Park. The UK triathlon, Orienteering   Society and Education are yet to confirm any dates and requirements. We   only at the end of January and already usage is already looking good. </p>
        <p><strong>7 Queen&rsquo;s Park Angling Review</strong></p>
        <p>Permit   visuals were made available for attendees to see – the artwork is very   profession and thanks were made to the Elaine Dodd. All indications are   that the Angling Initiative has been very successful to date and many   appreciative comments have been received from users and local Clubs. </p>
        <p>Ian   Henry reported that there are 27 temporary, trial pegs set out so far   and plans to create 3 disabled pegs with access. One of the pegs has   already been identified to be re-sited. Membership has been set at £5   per year or £3 for a day ticket. There are no fees for under 16s. There   is already a membership of 70. </p>
        <p>The group wants to promote active   and responsible youth involvement through negotiations for a coaching   day with Stapeley Angling and through liaison with the Police.   Hopefully, the group will be able to set up a member data base in the   future. </p>

        <h4 align="justify">The   report that the fishing is all going good is a total lie you only need   to look back over the last few weeks to see photographic evidence of   illegal activities and problems. Another report from a dog owner this   week of his dog being caught up in discarded fishing line. Above we   watched as the angler who are supposed to be responsible cast time and   time again with in inchs of the swans. Any good angler would bring his   rod in and wait for the swans to move and not endanger them. Whats going   to happen when its nice and the kids come out and others if they cant   control it now they will never control it. It going to be hell and a   safety nightmare  in the summer and someone will be hurt. For the   friends and CEC to tell lies that its all ok isnt helping action is   needed its just as bad as it was before. Below fishing under the bridge   off the pegs casting near ducks were are the bailiffs?</h4>

        <p><strong>8 ANTs Review</strong></p>
        <p>8.1   Chris Curran presented a report, beginning with the latest day of   action happening the day before the meeting, when 21 volunteers braved   the weather to work outside, tidying specific areas, whilst others   worked inside to refurbish benches and clean windows. </p>
        <p>The ANTs   have plans for the Community Garden to the rear of the East Lodge: they   are to initiate a design competition in a local Primary School, inviting   garden designs from pupils in 13 classes. The overall winner will   receive an award and the winning design is to be presented to garden   planners at (eg) Reaseheath College so that the design can be realised   and pupils can be involved in the very first &ldquo;digging&rdquo;. It was also   agreed that prizes for winners from each class should be provided. </p>
        <p>This   project is seen as a valuable way to involve children in the voluntary   workforce and to encourage responsible use of the Park. </p>
        <p>8.2 The   ANTs are also hoping to establish a group of volunteers who can come to   work in the Park outside the recognised Action Days. This is based on a   scheme at Birkenhead Park that now has a regular force of 80 volunteers,   especially retired people who would like to be involved. The ANTs are   looking to establish this activity with a signing in scheme and small   tool storage. </p>
        <p>8.3 The 23rd February is the next ANTs   Day of Action when volunteers will be joined by members of Slimming   World as part of their Body Magic Programme. </p>
        <p><strong>9 AOB</strong></p>
        <p><strong>9.1 Dogs in the Park</strong>:   Joanne Clewes gave a detailed account of how she was walking her dog on   a lead in the Park recently and was set upon by a large dog that was   not under control. The owner of the dog is known to the group. The   police and Elaine Dodd were informed and visited. The Dog Wardens and   PCSOs are to talk to the owner about maintaining a dog under control in   the Park. </p>
        <p>During detailed discussion, it was pointed out that   the &lsquo;Dog Control Order&rsquo; is being revisited and is to be updated,   however, the Council is looking for a wide order to cover several parks   and this could take some time. It was agreed that the Secretary should   write to George Broughton asking for the matter to be given more urgent   consideration in view of recent dog-related incidents. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <hr />

        <h4>The above is not a true account of what happened. The dog which has visited the park every day from a small puppy and is know to everyone as a friendly puppy pulled off the lead and went to play when this women's vicious staffy attacked it and had it by the throat. The dog being a puppy thought it was a game and just wanted to play.        As an Alaskan Malamute when full grown can bring down a polar bear if he had attacked it then it wouldnt be alive. This women then started a cyber bullying campaign on the Face book Group and several members joined in this nasty bulling and issuing threats of violence to a 67 year old man they have all now been reported for these offences but the admins of the site took no action. People are very brave sat behind a pc threatening an OAP but not so brave faced with 9 st of Malamute. What this women didnt point out was there in fact 3 witness to the incident. </h4>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>9.2 Structure Changes</strong>:   Derek Morgan introduced initial proposals for the new Parks structure   and expressed his concerns, especially in view of the loss of Park   Wardens. It is uncertain what will happen to the role of Park Manager.   The group would be most concerned if her support was diluted further in   any way and Derek assured the meeting that he would not hesitate to   write to relevant personnel if there are any developments. Howard Curran   pointed out the CE are losing staff and that it is hard to do anything   until possible outcomes are known. It was stressed again, that the post   of Park Manager should not be diluted in any way. </p>
        <p><strong>9.3 Improvements</strong></p>
        <p>Thanks were passed on for the new, privately purchased<strong> bench</strong>, sited close to the west gate and bandstand – this is much appreciated by daily dog walkers and visitors to the Park. </p>
        <p>9.4 It was also confirmed that two new <strong>notice boards</strong> are to be installed this week along the main drive and by the Tipkinder   entrance. The board formerly at the front gate is to be relocated at   the south gate (Moreton Road). </p>
        <p>9.5 In response to a question about the <strong>old depot</strong> and any developments about its demolition and use of the land, Charlie   Griffies replied that there is no further information. He was also able   to confirm funding procedures for the <strong>footpaths</strong>. Howard Curran asked about the <strong>steps</strong> from the Burma Star Island bridge to the south gate and was assured   that improved access through gentler gradients is part of the footpath   plans. </p>
        <p><strong>9.6 Power Boats on the lake</strong>: in response to   concerns about the use of large, remote controlled boats on the lake,   Elaine Dodd agreed to request guidance from George Broughton. There was a   lot of discussion about the impact on wildlife and any contamination   and it was suggested that incidents are logged for future reference. </p>

								<p>Spring is showing its head as the periwinkle

								periwinkles, normally have green leaves and
								single flowers in either purple, blue, pink or
								white. However there are double-flowered forms
								and variegated forms too so the choice is wide,
								although they all send out runners. The Lesser

								choice of colours and flower type. </p>

            <p>The   people fishing at the moment are supposed to be responsible fishermen   but they continue to be a menace we have had rods left in the lake while   the illegally use the bushes and leaving a rod unattended is also   illegal, we have discarded hooks, not fishing on the pegs. What they are   doing now using 30ft poles is blocking all the foot paths with their   poles so people can walk around the park in safety. This is going to be a   major problem in summer when lots of people want to walk down the paths   and cant. On Saturday they were fishing off the pegs, fishing down by   Tipkinder, blocking paths as you can see. If the fishing club cant   control these  people now when there is only  a few then come summer   when there are lots its going to be bedlam. One man acting as bailiff   who only comes around once a day simply wont cut it.    </p>

                  <p>A    new seat has arrived in the park under the big tree near the cafe which   is an ideal place to sit if its raining or nice and cool in the summer.   Its the first new one for a long time and its in memory of Eve &amp;   Reg Buckingham a family I have know for over 50 years I am sure it will   give a resting place to many tired people in the summer  </p>

                  <p>Applications   for the new footpaths  budgetary provision has been submitted and   passed Gateway 1, Gateway 2 is underway for presentation in Feb.    Hopefully, looking positive, however, full council approval required.    Jacobs engineers are working on the designs at this time, with hopefully   an early start in the new financial year, subject to the above.  </p>
                  <p>There   is still illegal  fishing on the lake as its supposed to be restricted   to the bottom half of the lake but people were out fishing today near   wildlife on Tipkinder end so much for bailiffs </p>

                    <p> The start of another new year in Queens Park its now   						over 6 years since I started the website it was supposed   						to last a year before it was all restored but we are   						still waiting for that day to come. As  you would expect   						this time of year there is very little happening in the   						park. We have had the idiots with their xmas present's   						of boats using them on the lake showing little regards   						for the wildlife. So we all thought there is a god when   						the idiot chasing ducks with the boat lost control and   						it ended up stuck in the middle of the lake.</p>
